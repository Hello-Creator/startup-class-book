Lecture 11: Company Culture and Building a Team, Part II 

Sam Altman: Part two of Culture and Team. We have Ben Silbermann, the founder of Pinterest, and John and Patrick Collison, the founders of Stripe. Founders that have obviously, some of the best thinking about culture and building their teams.

我們邀請到了Pinterest的創始人Ben Silverman
Stripe的創始人John Collison和Patrick Collison
他們三位是當前非常成功的創始人
想必他們在文化和團隊建設方面有獨到的見解


There's three areas we are going to cover today. One will be general thoughts on culture as a follow up on the last lecture. And then we are really going to dig in to the findings of these companies and building out the early team. Then how that changes and evolves as these guys have scaled their companies to the hundred plus, I don't even know how many employees you have now but quite a lot, these very large organizations and how they adapt these principles of culture. But to start off, I just want to ask a very open ended question which is, what are the core pieces of culture that you found to be the most important in building out your companies?

我們今天主要探討三個方面的問題
第一個是對文化的整體的思考
接著上節課的內容繼續討論
然後我們會深入討論
他們兩家公司是
如何組建最初團隊的
以及如何隨著公司的發展而變化的
當公司隊伍擴大到100人時該怎麼做
我不清楚你們公司現在有多少人肯定不少
當公司發展壯大時
如何調整文化戰略
我拋磚引玉問一個寬泛的問題
你們認為在創建公司中
文化建設方面最重要的是什麼？

Ben Silbermann: Sure. What are the most important parts? For us, we think on a few dimensions. One is who we hire, what those people value. Two is what we do every day. Why do we do it? Three is what we choose to communicate and I think four is how we choose to celebrate. Then the converse of this is what you choose to punish, but in general I think running a company based on what we celebrate is more exciting than what we punish. I think, the four things I think make up the bulk of it for us.

對我們公司而言有這麼幾個方面
第一是僱傭什麼樣的人？
這些人的價值觀是什麼樣的？
第二個是每天做什麼？為什麼這麼做？
第三是傳遞什麼？
第四是獎勵什麼？
當然與獎勵相對的是懲罰
我認為推崇獎勵的公司要比推崇懲罰的公司
更有活力
這四點構成了我們公司文化的框架

John Collison: One thing, I think Stripe has placed a large emphasis on, more so than other companies, is transparency internally. I think it's something that's been really valuable for Stripe, and a little bit misunderstood. All the things people talk about, like hiring really great people or giving them a huge amount of leverage.

與其他公司相比
我們公司在發展中更加重視
內部透明性
這點對於我們公司而言非常重要
也容易導致誤解
一般的公司經常強調的是
招募人才給他們良好的發展空間

Transparency for us plays into that. We think that if you are aligned on a high-level about what Stripe is doing, if everyone really believes in the mission, that if everyone has really good access to information, and everyone has a good picture of the current state of Stripe, then that gets you a huge amount on the way there in terms of working productively together. And it forgives a lot of the other things that tend to break as you grow a startup. So as we have grown, we started off two people, we’re now a hundred seventy people, we’ve put a lot of thought into the tooling that goes around, transparency. Because with a hundred and seventy people, there's so much information being produced that you can't just consume it all as a fire hose. And so, how we use email, things like that, we can go into it more later. But that's one of the core things that helped us work well.

而我們經常強調的是透明性
我們認為如果員工能被授權
看到Stripe的一舉一動
如果所有人都堅信公司使命
如果所有人都能
知曉公司的現狀
這樣就會看到
大家在努力高效地協作
這樣就會化解
在創業中遇到的很多問題
我們公司最初只有兩個人
我們現在有170多個人
我們在如何使“透明性”高效運作方面
花了很多心血
我們有170多個人每天產生那麼多信息
不可能讓所有人一下子都消化吸收了
我們用slack 用郵件等等方法
後面再詳細介紹
我認為這一點對於我們公司發展很重要

Patrick Collison: I think culture, to some degree is a resolution to a bandwidth problem. In the sense that, when you start out working on something you are coding all the time, but you can't code all the things that you think the product may need. And so the organization gets larger. Maybe in some idealized world, I don't actually think this is true, but ideally you should be involved in every single decision, in every single type of moment of the company, everything that happens, but obviously you can't. Or maybe you can if you're two people, but you certainly can't if you're five or ten. At that time, it comes very quickly, by a hundred and fifty, it's completely hopeless.

我認為某種程度上
文化可以使很多問題迎刃而解
例如說
你自己編寫代碼
但是你不可能一個人完成所有的工作
實現期待的所有功能
所以你得和其他程序員合作
這樣團隊就擴大了
或許理想情況下
當然不一定存在
理想情況下你可以參與所有的決議
可以參與公司所有的重要時刻
知曉公司的一切但是顯然這是做不到的
當公司只有兩個人的時候還能做到
但是人多了
當有了五個人十個人
五十個人就做不到了
And so culture is the invariant that you want to maintain, as you get specifically involved in fewer and fewer decisions over time. When you think about it that way, maybe intended importance becomes self-evident. Again, the fraction of things you can be involved in directly, diminishing, exponentially, assuming your headcount growth is on a curve that looks like one of the great companies. And yeah, that's super important. It manifests itself in a bunch of different ways. For example, in hiring, maybe the reason the first ten people you hire, the decisions are so important that aren't just hiring those first ten people, you are actually hiring a hundred people because you think each one of those people are going to bring along another ten people with them. And thinking exactly what ninety people that you would like those first ten people to bring on. It's going to be quite consequential for your company but really briefly I think it's about abstraction.

此時文化可以
把大家擰成一股力量
隨著公司的發展當每個人參與的決議越來越少
越來越專時
公司文化能把大家拉到同一水平線上
這麼來想的話
文化的重要性顯而易見
當你能直接參與的
事務的比例減小時
如果公司成功的話
人數會指數性增長事務也會指數性增長
這非常重要
可以在很多方面得到佐證
比如招募
最初招募的10個人
決定了公司今後的發展
招募時要慎重
因為這個舉措影響的不僅僅是十個人而已
影響的其實是一百個人
因為這十個人中的每個人
今後又會招募和領導十個人
要考慮清楚
想招募的後面90個人是什麼樣的
這對公司的影響是深遠的
簡而言之算是一種“概況”吧

Sam Altman: One thing a lot of speeches in this class have touched on is hiring those first ten employees. If you don't get that right, the company basically never recovers. But no one has talked about how to do that, so what have you looked for when you have hired these initial employees to get the culture of the company right? How have you found them?

很多嘉賓談到過招募最初的十名員工很重要
如果這一步不慎的話
基本上就會滿盤皆輸
但是沒人談過如何招募最初的十名員工
在招募最初的員工時
為了打造優秀的公司文化
你們三位看重的是什麼？
是如何發現人才的？你們期待什麼樣的人？

Ben Silbermann: I guess this answer is different for every company. I’ll say for us it was very inductive. Clearly I looked for people that I wanted to work with, and I thought were talented. I have read all these books on culture, because if I don't know something, the first thing I do is go read about it. Everyone has all these frameworks, so I think one big misconception that someone said once was, people think of culture as architecture when it is a lot more like gardening. You plant some seeds, then you pull out weeds when it's not working, and they sort of expand. When we first hired people, we hired people that were more like ourselves. I often looked for three to four things that I really valued in people. I looked for people who worked hard, had high integrity, low ego. I looked for people who were creative, super curious, which meant they had all these interests.


這個問題的答案因公司而異
對我們公司而言可以這麼來歸納
我希望找到
我個人喜歡與其共事的人才
我讀過關於文化的一些書
當我不知道該怎麼做的時候
我會看看相關的書看別人是怎麼做的
我覺得關於文化有個誤區
有人認為文化就像建築
其實文化更像園藝
就像播下種子拔去野草
這樣植物就能長好了
我們最初招募的都是和我們很像的人
招人時我通常會看一下這個人
是否具備我看重的三四個優點
分別是努力
正直謙虛
有創造力
他們通常好奇心強
有不同的愛好

Some of our first employees are some of the quirkiest you have ever met. They were engineers but they had all these crazy hobbies. Like one guy made his own board game, with his own elaborate set of rules. Another guy was really into magic tricks, and he not only coded a magic trick on an iPhone but he shot the production video in the preview. And I think that quirkiness is a calling card that we find, the people that are excited about many disciplines and extraordinary at once, tend to build really great products and are really great at collaborating.
最初招募的一些人是我見過的
極品“怪才”
他們是工程師同時有很奇特的愛好
例如說有個同事自創了有套紛繁規則的桌遊
另一個同事痴迷於魔術
他不僅開發了IOS版的魔術app
還拍了段介紹短片
這種奇特就是
我們要尋找的品質
這幫有創造力的奇特的人
對很多東西感興趣
在創造優秀產品方面更加勝任
他們更擅長合作
最後一點

And the last thing, we really want someone who wants to build something great. And they aren't arrogant about it, they want to take a risk and build something bigger than themselves. And that, in the beginning, is very easy to select for. If you were in our position, we were in this horrible office, nobody got paid. There was no external reason to stay except wanting to build something to join. In fact there was every reason not to. And that's something, looking back, that I really value. Because you always knew people were joining for the purest of reasons and in fact forgoing other job opportunities, market salary, a clean office, good equipment just for the chance to work here. To this day, I think a lot of those traits are seeded and embedded in the folks that we look at now.

我們尋找那些想要打造出優秀產品的人
他們並非恃才傲物
只是覺得挑戰自我打造優質產品
是件很酷的事
在我們創業初期
對方是否是我們要找的人一眼就能看出來
我們當時辦公室條件很糟沒錢開工資
除了對我們的項目感興趣外
沒什麼加入我們的理由
不加人我們的理由倒是一籮筐
感興趣才是
最重要的
顯然當時加入我們的人有著最純粹的理由
他們願意拒絕其他好的工作機會
拒絕了相稱的工資體面的辦公室
精良的設備而加入我們
今天看來元老們的很多優秀品質
在我們公司生根發芽

John Collison: The first ten hires is really hard, because you're making these first ten hires at a point where no one's heard of this company before. Nobody wants to work with you. You are these two weird people working on this weird idea-

前十名員工是很難招到的
因為此時
你的公司沒什麼名氣
沒什麼人願意加入你們
只有兩個古怪的小伙子從事古怪的點子
而且親朋好友也會勸他們不要跟你們幹
比如說我們公司的第二名員工
當時他已經答應我們的offer了或者說是打算接受

Patrick Collison: Their friends are telling them not to join. For our second employee, he either accepted the offer or was just about to, and his best friends took him out the night before, it was a full on assault, why you should not join this company. Why it is ruining your life basically. And the guy continued to join, actually one of those friends now works at Stripe, but this is what you are up against.

就在接受offer前一晚他的好朋友們把他叫出去
給他講了一大通
為什麼不要加入我們公司
會毀了他的前途什麼的
不過他最終還是加入我們了
而且其中他的一個好朋友現在也在我們公司
這些情況你們都是要面對的

John Collison: And it's hard, no batch of ten people will have as big of an influence on the company as those first ten people. And I think that everyone's impression of recruiting is you open LinkedIn and it's sort of like ordering off the dollar menu, I want that one, that one, that one and now you have some hires. At least for us, it was over a very long time period talking to people we knew, or friends of friends into joining. We didn't have huge networks, we were both still in college by then. So there were really no people that we worked with to draw in. So a lot of those early Stripers were people we heard of from friends.

難招這批人的另一個原因是
他們對公司的影響是後來者難以企及的
大家可能覺得招募就是打開LinkedIn（領英）
像點菜一樣“點”幾個人
這個這個這個
就搞定了
至少對我們而言我們花了很多時間
勸說知道的人和朋友的朋友加入我們
我們當時沒有很廣的人脈
我倆只是大學生而已
也沒有什麼乾爹可以依靠
我們公司招到的人都是我們聽說的一些人
朋友的朋友什麼的

The other interesting thing they had in common, they were all really early in their career or undervalued in some way. Think about it, if someone is a known spectacular quantity, then they are probably working in a job and very happy about it. So we had to try to find people who were, in the case of our designer that we hired, he was eighteen and in high school and in Sweden at the time. As the case with our CTO, he was in college at the time. A lot of these people, they were early on in their careers, and the only way we could, you can relax one constraint, you can relax the fact that they are talented, or relax the fact that it's apparent that they are talented. And we, not consciously, we relaxed the latter.

我們招到的人的另一個相同點是
事業剛起步或是被屈才了
因為想想看嘛
如果一個人有名氣了
很可能他對自己的工作很滿意不願意跳槽
你們要找的就是那些不如意的人
比如說我們招的一個工程師
只有18歲還在瑞士上高中
比如說我們的CTO當時在讀大學
很多這樣的人
他們剛開始事業
這樣本來很緊張的地方你就可以放鬆點了
在判斷他們是否有才方面就可以放鬆點了
顯然他們很有才華
當然並非是有意識地放鬆

Patrick Collison: Finding the right people, you have to think like a value investor right, you're looking for the human capital that's significantly valued by the market. You probably shouldn't look to hire your friends from Facebook, and Google, or whatever, they are already discovered, and if they want to join you, that's great. They are probably harder to convince. John has spent a little while yesterday afternoon trying to figure out in retrospect, what traits out first ten people had in common and felt were significant. Generally speaking in culture I want to carry out everything we say, advice is very little advice, wildly extrapolated and I think there is a lot of truth to that.
招人
就像是投資
你要挖掘那些
被低估了的人才
一般不要招募那些在Facebook Google這樣的公司
已經風生水起的人才
因為他們已經被挖掘了
如果他們願意加入你的話當然最好
不過很難說服他們
John和我昨天下午
回顧了一下
我們最初招到的十個人的特質
我們認為重要的相同之處
在文化方面
雖然我想知無不言
但是這方面
我們經驗有限
文化方面有很多學問
不過對於我們而言

For our first ten people, the things that seemed to be important, they were also very genuine and straight. And I think that matters quite a lot, there are people that others want to work with. That there are others that people trust, that they are intellectually honest on how they approach problems. They are generally people who like to get things finished. There are a lot of people who are really excited about tons of things. Only some of those are excited about completing things. There is a lot of talk out there, like hiring people off their GitHub resumes, that doesn't really ring correct to me as there is a large premium on lots of different things. I think it's much more a priori, much more interesting to work with someone who took two years to spend time going deeper into an area. And then the third trait that we looked for is that they cared a great deal, it's offensive to them when something is just a little off.
最初招的十個人很重要的特質是
誠懇直接
這兩點很重要
這樣的人
才會得到別人的信任
別人才願意與其共事
他們在遇到問題時
表現誠實
還有一點就是善始善終
有很多人對很多東西感興趣
只有很少的人對“善終”
感興趣
目前盛傳
招人就看GitHub簡歷
不過我不贊同
目前
大家推崇
做了很多不同的項目的應聘者
我反而更欣賞那種
更願意與那種
在某個領域鑽研了兩年的那種人
共事
他們的第三個共同點是
很用心
哪怕有一點的偏差
都會讓他們抓狂
In hindsight there were all these crazy things that we use to do that, do in fact, seem crazy. Like I should have not done them. Everyone was always like, it was borderline insane how much they cared about tiny details like we used to. Every single API request that ever generated an error went to all of our inboxes and phoned all of us. Because it seemed terrible to get an error that didn't get a resolution from the users standpoint. Or we used to copy everyone else on outgoing email and point out slight grammar or spelling mistakes to each other. Because it would be horrible to ever send an email with a spelling mistake. Anyways, those are the three traits we came up with, genuine, caring a great deal, and completing things.
事後回想起來
我們做了很多瘋狂的事
一些看似瘋狂不該做的事
大家對細節的糾結
幾乎到了瘋狂的地步
每次API請求出現錯誤
我們每個人都會收到郵件通知
都會接到電話
因為從用戶角度考慮
錯誤解決不了是很糟糕的
我們過去常常給所有人群發郵件
我們會相互指出
語法和拼寫錯誤
因為發的郵件有拼寫錯誤是很遜的
以上就是他們的三個相同點
真誠用心第二點是什麼來？
第二點是？
對善始善終
Ben Silbermann: I have something to say, I don't think there is a wrong place to find people. So when I look back at our first hires we hired, they came from all over the place. I put up ads on craigslist, I went to random Techtalks, we used to throw weekly BBQ’s at the office, bring your own food and drinks and then we would just talk to folks. I think every time I went to get coffee at Philz, one of you guys were recruiting. Because your office was strategically placed next to the best coffee shop. But I think the really good people, generally are doing something else so you have to go seek them out instead of expecting that they are going to seek you out. Triple when no one has ever heard of or is using the product that you work on.
我想說
任何途徑都可以發現人才
我回想了一下我們最初招到的幾個人
他們來自四面八方我在Craigslist上打過廣告
逛過技術沙龍
我們還
每週在辦公室辦燒烤聚會
大家自帶食物和飲品
我們會跟大家交流
每次我在Palo Alto喝咖啡
都會有你們的人在Coopa招人
因為他們的公司有“地利”優勢
靠近這家最好的咖啡店
我認為
有些人才在做著其他事情
你要把他們挖過來
而不是被動地等他們找上門來
當沒人聽說或是用你們的產品時
在招人方面你要更賣力
John Collison: Yeah and it's probably really important to have a great elevator pitch, not just for investors but because everyone that you run into right now is six months to a year down the road a recruit. So the right time to have gotten them excited about your product, the right time for them to have started following us, is as soon as it can start. It's going to take a very long time to recruit people, so getting people consistently excited about what you are doing will pay back later.
適時地展現你們公司是很重要的
不僅僅是針對投資者
你目前遇到的每個人都是潛在員工
都有可能六個月或一年後被收入你的麾下
適時讓他們對你們公司感興趣
適時讓他們開始追隨你
開始思考
今後的發展方向
要儘早開始
招募要花很長時間
要持續地讓你們對你們公司感興趣
這樣在招募時就會輕鬆一些
Patrick Collison: Maybe this is a little tangential, but a bunch of our friends started companies right out of school. And we started thinking, what goes wrong in those companies? And I think the most common failure mode was doing something overly niche, overly specific or bad. I think there is a major shift in time horizon as you go from classes to a startup. A class plays out on a quarter, or a semester, where a startup is a five or ten year thing. And I think this is really problematic, because it's really quite hard to hire people for niche things. If you told someone, look we are going to build a rocket that goes Mars, that sounds almost impossible but sounds fucking awesome. It's really easy to convince people to work on it. Instead of, well we are going to work on, I'm not going to give any specific idea, probably going to sound like we are doing a startup. But if you pick something pretty narrow, generally comes out of this class project that's actually much harder to hire for.
昨天下午我和John還談到
我們有很多朋友
也在大學時創業
我們思考了一下
他們的公司為什麼會失敗
我們認為他們的失敗可能是最常見的失敗模式
因為做的東西有特定的用戶群
太專太狹小了
我覺得可能是由於
從上學到創業
有時間上的轉換
上課都是
一季度一季度的或是一學期一學期的\N312\N00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:0​​0,110\N創業卻需要五年或十年\N313\N00:15:0​​0,110 --> 00:15:0​​2,440\N我覺得這點比較棘手\N314\N00:15:0​​2,440 --> 00:15:0​​6,230\N因為很難僱人從事有特定用戶群的工作\N315\N00:15:0​​6,230 --> 00:15:0​​8,000\N如果你跟別人說\N316\N00:15:0​​8,000 --> 00:15:11,190\N我們要打造飛向火星的火箭
雖然聽起來不怎麼靠譜
但是太TM酷了
很容易
說服別人一起幹
如果你說你想打造…
我就不舉例了
因為聽起來
像是我在做似的
如果你選的創業方向很“專”
可能創意來自於
課程作業中遇到的問題
Sam Altman: One specific specific question that has come up a lot is how, as a relatively inexperienced founder, you identify who the really good people are. So you meet people at these BBQ’s, you are friends, maybe you have worked with them. What did you guys do specifically to identify that this person was going to be really great? Or did you really get it wrong? When did you learn you could identify raw talent? Or say they work at Google, or Facebook so they must be good.

在招人時要費更大的勁
一個常見的問題是
作為相對而言經驗欠缺的創始人
你們是如何判斷什麼樣的人是人才呢
你們在燒烤聚會上見到的那些人
還有朋友的朋友
或許你們與他們共事過
你們到底是
通過什麼樣的機制判定\N337\N00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53​​,180\N某個人是人才的？\N338\N00:15:53​​,180 --> 00:15:54,380\N或是你們有什麼教訓？
你們從中汲取到什麼？
除了他們在Google或Facebook工作過
你們是如何判定某人是稀有人才的？

Ben Silbermann: You will never 100% know until you work with folks. So the flip side is, if the person you hired is not a good fit, you owe it to them and to the company to tell them where to improve and if they aren't working out, then to fire them. But I think, generally, the question of talent falls into two big buckets. One is, you have some sense of what makes them good at their job. And there are some areas where you can test that area. And there are some that you don't. And the ones where you don't are much more difficult. So what we would do is a few things.
在這點上不可能做到100%確定
除非和他們共事後
事與願違的話
如果招到的人不勝任
公司就得買單
要告訴他們如何提高
實在不行就得炒掉他們
覺得一般而言
在資質這個問題上要考慮兩個方面
第一是哪些品質有助於他們勝任工作
大家應該有些個人感悟
其次就是哪些缺點不合適你們的工作
缺點在判斷時佔的分量更大
Before we talk to anyone, we try to figure out what exactly is world class in that discipline need. And this comes in a little later when you are hiring the head of finance and you know nothing about finance, except what is contained in a library book that you got. Like an introduction to finance or marketing. So I always made it a habit of mine to talk to people I knew de facto were world class and just asking them, what are the traits you look for? What are the questions you ask? And how to find them? If you are looking for the next person that is as good as you, where is that person working right now and what's her phone number? I think that learning what's good and bad during the interview process is extremely expensive. It is an expensive use of your time, expensive use of everyone else's time. A recalibration of that really matters.
我們會做一些準備工作
比如首先我們先了解一下
在某個領域做到優秀是什麼樣的
這點在後面會變得很重要
比如你要雇個財務主管
但是你對財務一竅不通
你頂多也就在圖書館看過點相關書籍
有點入門知識
僱營銷總管也是如此
我通常這麼做
我找一位該領域的優秀人士
向他們請教
他們看重的關鍵的品質有哪些？
他們在招賢納士時問的問題有哪些？
如果他們想招一位和他們一樣優秀的專業人才
要去哪找？
有沒有合適人選的電話？
Then once you have someone in an interview process, you will build the process over time to screen quality. Pinterest, we have an evolving set of questions that are rotating through and we are always asking if these are good indicators or bad indicators of quality. The other thing the questions are supposed to do is give us a sense of, is this the right place for this person to come in and work? This is the point you guys made about being very transparent. About what's going to be easy or hard. Really great people want to do things that are going to be hard. They want to solve tough problems, so there was a sense of brilliance in Google sending out these interview questions that were thought to be really difficult. Then people who like solving problems, they come out and seek those. I think it's really important as companies get bigger that they don't whitewash the risks. I heard that Paypal, you go in and after the interview they say, by the way, Mastercard wants to kill us and you will be doing something that is illegal, but if you succeed you will redefine payments. Or when they were recruiting for iPhone, they didn't even tell people what they were doing. You won't see your families for three years, but when you are done, your kids, your kids' kids will remember what you built. I think that's a really good thing in recruiting as well. Be very very transparent on why you think it's a great idea, but you lay out in gory detail why it's going to be hard. And then the right people select in or they select out of that opportunity.

我認為
在面試中熟悉應聘者的優缺點
是很耗時的
很耗你自己的時間
也很耗對方的時間
有套完善的評判標準是很重要的
這樣面試的時候
你就有章可循
對於我們Pinterest而言
我們有套不斷完善的標準問題
我們在不斷地完善
不斷地衡量這些問題是否是優秀的“指示劑”
另一方面這些問題
可以讓應聘者來了解
我們公司是不是適合他們
他們兩位在什麼輕鬆什麼困難上
做得很透明
非常優秀的人才喜歡
解決困難的問題
在這點上Google做得很巧妙
他們給應聘者出的問題
看起來非常難
因為那些喜歡困難問題的人
就會被吸引過來
即使是公司做大了
不避諱地談工作風險也是很重要的
我聽說PayPal是這麼做的
Peter Thiel和Max Levchin面試完後
會對面試者說Visa和MasterCard這樣的巨頭
會把我們逼向絕路的我們可能會做點違法的事
如果你成功了工資可以由你來定
當iPhone招聘時
甚至不告訴面試者他們要做什麼
告訴他們可能三年見不到家人
不過一旦成功了就名垂青史了
我覺得在面試時開誠佈公挺好的
告訴對方
為什麼你們的工作是絕佳的機遇
也詳細點告訴他們為什麼你們的工作很難
這樣的話他們就會做出判斷
是否加入你們


Patrick Collison: Evidence suggests they were able to see their kids though.

事實證明能與家人見面
對工作是有積極作用的

John Collison: I think one thing you have to do when identifying talent is have the confidence to interview in a way that works for you. I think, say you are not the world's best engineer and you are trying to interview engineering candidates. I thinks it's tempting to co-opt what everyone else does, get them to put things on a whiteboard and do other engineering things. In the case of Stripe, we flew a guy out and we spent a weekend coding with him and looking over his shoulder. It was the only way we could tell and get ourselves confident if that guy was any good. And I think you can extend that to any roles you are not an expert in. In that I am no business development guru but when we hire for business development roles, we have a project that we have them talk about, how they would improve an existing project that Stripe has or which new projects they would go out and do. And even if it is not my domain area, I am confident enough I can judge those really well. I think people often have this imposter syndrome when it comes to interviewing for roles.

我覺得在招賢納士方面
可以自信地用一種
適合自己的方式來做
比如說你本身不算是
最優秀的程序員
你要面試一些程序員
你可能傾向於用大眾化的面試方法
在面試板上記下對方的表現
諸如此類的大眾化的做法
我們Stripe在招第一位工程師的時候
我們和他一起編了一周的代碼
我們會觀察他的表現
只有這樣
我們才確定了
對方的確是人才
我覺得可以把這種方法
擴展到你本身不是專業人士的其他方面
我本身不是業務拓展方面的專業人士
當我們面試業務拓展人員時
我們會讓對方做個項目
讓他們談談
如何進一步完善Stripe現有的合作關係
或者開拓什麼樣的合作關係
你知道的雖然這不是我的專業領域
不過通過這樣的方法我能很好地做出判斷
有些人會在面試的時候
不懂裝懂

Patrick Collison: I think a specific tactical thing to do, again, for the first ten people is to work with them as much as you can before committing to hire them. Once you hit a certain scale it's kind of impractical to put them on that side and be unskilled. Expensive from your side. But it's really worth it to the first ten people, right. In the majority, the first ten people, we worked with them to some capacity for a week in advance. It's pretty hard to fake it for a week, it tends to be quite clear quickly. Another answer I thought of to the question, how do you know if someone if great? And people talk about this notion of the 10x person or what the skill set is. I don't know what 10x means. I think the slightly more intuitive decision is, is this person the best out of all of their friends at what they do? It's a little insensitive on how they choose among friends, but for me at least I find that a better way to think about it is, is this the best engineer this engineer knows? And the other thing worth mentioning is, on the first ten people on the culture and team topic, I think everyone doesn't realize until they go through it themselves, how important it is because in life and media people focus too much on founders. Here we are and we are reinforcing the structural narrative that Stripe is about John and Patrick and Pinterest is about Ben. When the vast majority of what our companies do, 99% are done by people that are not us, right? It's obvious when you say it but it's very much not the macro narrative. These are abstracts and you associate them with certain people. For companies like Apple and others, Steve Jobs was a tiny, tiny part at the end.

最初的10名員工
在招募的時候要特殊對待
在確定招募他們之前
盡可能多地和他們共事
當公司規模擴大到一定程度時
這種方法就不實際了很耗對方時間
也很耗你自己的時間
很不可取
這種方法在招前10名員工時是很值的
多數情況下
我們與最初的10名員工共事一段時間
通常是一周
能裝一周是很難的
一周差不多就能看清對方
我想到的另一點是
在如何判斷對方是否夠勝任
這個問題上
人們通常會提到十個特點這個概念
具備什麼技能
我不清楚這到底是什麼意思
我覺得可能是
直覺地判斷
某個人在他們那個圈子裡是不是最好的
可以關註一下
他們的朋友是什麼樣的有多少朋友
對我而言
我覺得想想
他是不是他知道的工程師中最好的更有用
還有一件事值得一提
在招募最初的10名員工時
或者寬泛點說在文化以及招募上
我覺得大家只有在親身經歷過後
才意識到這有多麼重要
很大程度上是因為生活中媒體上等等
人們對創始人過於關注
就像我們
有點像
大家過於強調
stripe是John和Patrick打造的
Pinterest是Ben打造的等等
其實
我們公司的絕大多數或者說99.9%的工作
都不是我倆做的
對吧？
我的意思是
大家說的時候心裡是清楚的
公司是很抽象的東西
所以大家傾向於將它和具體的人掛鉤
但是要知道
比如說蘋果公司
Steve Jobs只佔很小的一部分
Google也是類似的

John Collison: So don't screw up is what you are saying?
所以別搞砸這是你想表達的意思吧？
Patrick Collison: Something like that.
差不多吧
Ben Silbermann: I think referencing people is really important Referencing people is just what it sounds like. Asking people with experience for their honest opinion. We do that really aggressively but we are trying to figure out what this person is like to work with. We are trying not to validate if they told the truth on their resumes because we assume they told the truth. So a very standard question is in an interview I might say, hey we both know Jonathan, because we are both friends, if I asked him what you are best at, what you are the most proud of, or what you were working to improve, what would he or she say? Because it creates social awareness and accountability. Then I typically ask something that makes the question, that is typically soft, feel a little bit more quantitative and then calibrate that over time. To evaluate this person's dimensions, is this person the top 1% of the people you worked with, the top 5%, and the top 10%? And it forces scarcity that gives them material reference. Instead of saying, hey what's the best thing about John? You say, he told me he was good at these things. Can you validate it? Yeah, sure. It's the type of tool that should be taken seriously.
推薦人很重要
顧名思義
問一下與候選人共事過的人
問一下他們的意見
我們在這方面很重視
我們想知道
這個人喜歡和什麼樣的人合作
我們並不是想核實
這個人在簡歷上寫的是不是實話
我們直接假定他們的簡歷是真實的
我會在面試中問一些標準式問題
比如我會說我們都認識Jonathan
我和他是朋友
過幾週我會跟他交流一下
如果我問他你擅長什麼
你最為之驕傲的是什麼
你做過什麼
他會怎麼說呢？
這有點像自我意識測試
增強一下社會意​​識
然後我會問一些問題
比較柔和但是量化的問題
在這次過程中不斷修正對面試者的定位
可以這麼來問
這個人屬於你共事過的前1%優秀的人嗎？
前5%？前10%？
還可以補充問一下
比如John最大的優點什麼？
他告訴我他擅長什麼什麼你覺得呢？
他們會比較客觀地回答
大家可以好好研究一下這種方法
John Collison: And referencing, obviously, isn't easy to begin with. But it does provide really useful over time. And I think for name references people do want to be nice so you have to create an artificial scarcity by saying, where would you rank this person with people you worked with. You should aim to spend fifteen minutes on the phone with that person instead of letting them say, yeah this person is awesome.

的確
詢問推薦人這種方法開始不好操作
但是實踐證明這種方法的確有效
尤其是實名推薦人
他們很友善
所以要人為製造一些問題
比如說
在這個領域你共事過的人中
這個人能排第幾？
你要從推薦人口中得到更多有效信息
我通常會給他們打電話
得打15分鐘吧
而不是推薦人說某人不錯後你就掛掉電話了

Sam Altman: Also those references are a tremendous source of recruits. Once you hire these first people and they join, what have you done to make them effective quickly and to get them to the right culture place? Hiring is usually difficult but then not as difficult as making them happy and effective. So what do you do with these early employees to accomplish that?

其實這也是招募新人的寶貴資源
的確
推薦人也是招募新人的寶貴資源
在最初的員工加入時
你們有什麼經驗
可以讓他們更有效率？
讓他們融入到
你們的文化中
招人的確是挺難的
不過讓員工滿意和有效更是難上加難
針對最初招募的員工你們是怎麼做的呢？

Ben Silbermann: Well the answer to that has changed since we went from small to bigger. When we first started it was because we needed that person, a long time ago. So their whole onboarding was, here's your computer, we already set up your environment, don't worry about it, this is the problem we have to solve together. That's the nature of the startups, we were all in this tiny two bedroom apartment. All the other things, building personal relationships, spending time together, it all happened magically. You didn't have to do anything.
公司由小變大
我們的做法也隨著變化
我們剛開始創業的時候
我們招到的人是
瞄準已久了的
他們一來我們就迫不及待地介紹這是你的電腦
我們已經給你搭建好環境了
這是我們要一起解決的問題
由於創業初期條件有限
我們擠在兩室的公寓裡
所謂的人際關係建立
相處了解什麼的都是順其自然的
不用刻意做什麼
The one thing I would like to add to that is we always reminded people where we want to go with that someday. Because it's really easy to drop someone into a problem and they would think the whole world was this little problem in front of them. We would always say, someday we want to do for Google what they did for search. Our plan for trying to get that done.
我要補充一點
我們經常提醒大家
我們的目標是什麼
讓員工
投入解決一個具體的問題比較簡單
他們會有種感覺
周圍都是細小的問題而沒有大的方向
我們會告訴員工今後我們在發現領域的地位\N573\N00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,83​​0\N如同Google在搜索領域的地位\N574\N00:25:34,83​​0 --> 00:25:37,300\N這是我們的遠大目標

Now as the company grows, I think that problem has to get a little more formalized. So we spend a lot of time thinking and constantly trying to refine what that person looked like from the day they came in, to their first interview, through 30 days after they joined. Do they have someone's name they know? Do they know who their manager is? Have they sat down people on their team? Do they know what the general arch of the company is? And what the top priorities are? And we have a program we do. It's a week long and they have functions to go in deeper. And that's something that has always been refined. And the output metrics on that is one, we ask people, what did you think afterwards, then 30 days afterwards? Then we also ask their peers and manager, hey is this person up to speed? Do you feel we did a good job at making them productive? If we haven't then thats a key that a) we should not be hiring any more people because we're not doing a good job bringing in new people and b) we need to retool that.

現在公司變大了
這方面的做法就規範化一些了
我們會花時間
考核一下
他們進入公司以來的表現如何？
從第一次面試開始算30天后
他們知道哪些員工的名字？
知道經理的名字嗎？
與團隊成員熟絡了嗎？
知道公司的大體情況嗎？
知道公司的首要任務是什麼嗎？
我們也有一些為期一周的項目
項目有不同的針對點
這些項目也在不斷地完善
我們最重要的評判準則是
我們在30天后
問新員工的想法
我們也會詢問他的同事和經理的意見
這個員工能跟得上節奏嗎？
我們在讓新員工高效方面做好保障工作了嗎？
如果沒做好的話那麼首先
這個團隊不能再招人了
因為沒有為新員工做好保障工作
而且我們要對此進行整改


I think those things are important. I just wouldn't discount how important it is to get to know the person as a person. What's their aspirations? What's their working style? How do they like to be recognized? Do they really prefer being in total silence? Are they a morning person or night person? Knowing those things, it just demonstrates that you care about them individually and collectively, what your goals are.

我覺得這些事情挺重要的
以與人相處的形式關心員工
我認為是很重要的
比如他們的志向是什麼？他們工作方式怎樣？
他們喜歡以什麼樣的形式被認識？
他們渴望在很安靜的環境中工作嗎？
他們喜歡早起早睡還是喜歡晚起晚睡？
熟悉員工這些喜好
會讓他們感受到
你不僅關心大集體比如團隊目標是什麼

John Collison: I think there are two things that are important at any stage, though the implantation will change. First is to get them up and running quickly to do the work. That is how you are going to find the problems, it is how progress is measured in the real work they are doing. And so when we have engineers start, we try to get them committing on the first day. When we have people in business roles start, we will have them in real meetings the first day on what they are meant to be working on. Sometimes it's easy to be tentative and ease people in. We are much more, push people off the cliff. Then second, we try to quickly give people feedback. Expectedly giving people feedback on how to adapt to the culture. When you think about it, if you have built a strong culture as all the companies up here are trying to, it's going to take some adapting from the person, it's not going to be necessarily easy. One thing we have at Stripe is the culture is a lot more written. So you have people next to each other, with headphones on, IMing each other. And for a lot of people coming in and working in an environment like that it's sort of hard-

也關心他們每個人
隨著公司的發展
有兩點是一直很重要的
第一點是讓他們快速地正式開始工作
只有工作了才能發現問題
才能衡量這個人做的實際工作有多少
工程師新加入我們公司時
第一天我們就讓他們開始工作
業務方面的員工剛加入
第一天我們就讓他們參加正式會議
或者是做其他該崗位要做的工作
大多數公司會傾向於有個過渡時期
讓員工慢慢安頓下來
我們會像老鷹一樣把員工“推向懸崖”
第二點就是
盡快給員工反饋
尤其是在文化適應方面的反饋
這麼來想一想
如果你們公司​​有很強的文化
我們這些公司都在
盡力讓新員工適應公司文化
對於新員工來說適應並非易事
我們Stripe的文化
更像是明文規定
這麼說吧
我們的員工並排坐著
每個人都帶著耳機
用即時通信工具進行交流
所以
很多新員工不適應


Patrick Collison: In from normal places.

John Collison: Exactly yeah. So from everything high level of how you are doing at your job to minor cultural issues, the more feedback you give them, the better they will do. Its unnatural to be telling people if they are doing a good or bad job. You don't do that in your normal life, hopefully you are restrained. But when you have employees that is what you owe them to do well.
他們沒有在我們這樣的環境中呆過
適應起來有些困難
一般公司都不這樣
的確
事無鉅細
大到工作表現
小到文化指標
給他們的反饋越多他們就會變得越好

在日常生活中
不斷地告訴別人哪些地方做的好哪些地方做的不好
是很彆扭的
不要這麼做
日常生活中這是不可取的
但是在員工這
這確是你應該做的

Sam Altman: So I think this is a good transition to when you're companies have scaled. What are the biggest changes you have had to make to your hiring policies and to how you manage the teams as you have gone from two to ten to a thousand employees?
我也認同你們這種做法
當你們公司擴大了
在招人方面
你們最大的變化是什麼？
Ben Silbermann: There are a lot of changes. I think one thing we try to do on the team side is to make the teams feel as autonomous and nimble as possible within the constraints of the organization. That means over time we are trying to make it feel like a startup of many startups. Rather than this model setup with form policies cut horizontally through it. It's easier said than done, I don't think we are all the way there but one goal is that each team has control, to hold the resources that they need to get the goal done. They know what the most important thing is and how it's measured. That way the management problem because somewhat tractable. Otherwise it feels completely impossible if you can't decompose it into atomic components. You just look at it like, Oh my gosh, complexity level is rising geometrically, on a management level, it's never going to work.

有很多的變化
在團隊建設方面我們的一個做法是
盡量讓目標
驅動團隊
當公司變大了
那麼隨著公司的不斷發展
我們盡力讓公司像是
創業公司不斷再生出更多的創業公司
而不是壟斷公司那樣
一刀切地進行管理
說起來容易做起來難
我們並非一直做得很好
我們的一個目標是
每個團隊都能控制好自己的資源做好工作
知道最重要的是什麼以及如何來衡量
這樣的話
管理問題就變得有章可循了
否則的話不能分成一個個小的自動模塊的話
團隊就沒法管理了
你發現
交流複雜度呈指數型增長
管理根本沒法做了

You have to create these abstracted units. At least that's what we are going to try to do. Pinterest in particular, the real challenge with building those abstract units is, we want units that encompass a super strong designer, or a super strong lead engineering, a writer, often times a community leader. We want them to be self contained. That kind of makes it hard, but that kind of core is to our philosophy to build products. We put people together that have all these kind of disciplines, lots of things then we anchor them to a certain project then we try to remove barriers to let them go fast. Then we find no barriers and we sit down to figure out how we speed that up. I think hiring is a little different. I think the biggest change and the biggest asset you get is the people, referrals become more and more the life blood depending on the network of the people you bring in. So one of the lucky and in hindsight decisions we made was our actual fourteenth or fifteenth person we hired was a professional recruiter. She worked at startups, she worked at big companies like Apple. But she sort of knew where that pipeline breaks down. Knew the early indicators, and taught everyone not just how to screen for talent but to identify the people who are going to be culturally really good for the company. And I think looking back on that, its something I personally really value.
所以要分成一個個單元
至少我們是朝這個方向發展的
拿Pinterest來說
在分割方面遇到的很大的一個困難是
我們想讓每個單元都有
很牛的工程師帶頭人
寫手社區管理人等等
我們希望他們聚合在一起
要達到這樣的目標很難實施
這其實也是我們打造產品的核心哲學觀
我們想把不同領域的人
聚在一起
這些人對很多東西感興趣
我們讓他們聚焦到一個項目上
然後我們全力移除障礙讓他們更快地前進
遇到了新障礙我們會坐下來思考
我們如何進行化解
我覺得在僱人方面有些不同
當公司員工越來越多時
最大的變化就是
推薦人制度變得越來越重要
在招人方面更依賴於
團隊裡已有的人的關係網
事後看來
我們很幸運
因為我們招到的第14位或15位員工
是個很專業的​​獵頭她在創業公司呆過
也在蘋果這樣的大公司呆過
她能洞悉哪個地方出問題了
有先見之明
她教會我們不僅以才華作為篩選指標
也要考慮一下候選人是否能
融入公司文化
事後來看
我很欣賞她的做法
Patrick Collison: There is a huge amount of stuff here that is under management growth. Either your company fails really quickly or all of your problems become about management growth. One thing that tends to take people by surprise, and took me by surprise, is how quickly the time horizons change. In your first month, you are largely thinking about things one month ahead, right? Maybe that is what your development road map is oriented around. Who you are working with, maybe it's a very informal relationships where they haven't fully committed to be full time or not. The more time that goes by, I feel that has a reciprocal in the time horizons.
這個問題涉及到很多東西
有點像是增長管理中的問題
不管是公司很快就失敗了還是騰飛了
都涉及很多增長管理問題
有一點會讓人大吃一驚
也讓我大吃一驚
就是時間窗變化得太快了
第一個月
只要想好今後一個月的事就行了
制定出
公司的發展方向
此時與你共事的人
可能
你們還沒有建立正式的關係
他們還沒有完全投入你們的事業中
隨著時間的推移
就像在時間窗上
有了個互補或者相應的增量
In one year, you are thinking a year ahead. After four years you are thinking four years ahead. That increases very quickly right? After one month it's super short term. After eleven months, you should actually be thinking and planning a year ahead and think about human structures. Thinking about stuff Ben talked about. Where you want to be going long term. Things like that. I think that plays into the hiring and that in the early days you have to hire people who are going to be productive. Essentially , you don't have the luxury of hiring people that look to be promising but they are not going to be up to speed for another year or two. They have to be able to work immediately. But after two or three years, then it becomes much more reasonable to make those investments.
一年後就得想好下一年的事
四年後就得​​想好下四年的事
這樣增長地很快
你想啊
想好一個月的事還算簡單
11個月後得
計劃好下一年的事
也得想好基於相應時間窗的人事結構
就像Ben提到的那樣
想好長期的的目標等等
在僱人上
也要考慮到這樣的因素
在創業早期
要雇那些高效率的人
迅速投入工作的人
僱傭那些有前途
但是一兩年都跟不上節奏的人你耗不起
僱傭的人必須馬上出成效
兩三年後在僱人方面做點投資
就比較合理了

Actually if you are not making those investments you are probably being much too short term. And so I think that's really important. All of these problems in some sense are easy. Like, how do you build such good bonds with people? We all do it every day. How do you make it systematic, and effective at scale? It's all going to vary significantly, in perfect proximation of what you would ideally do small, what hacks can you pull? Make it work as well as you possibly can at a large scale. A rapidly growing company, with head count here two-three heads a year, it's a very unnatural thing. What's the least bad way of managing that growth? I think it's worth being systematic about it, thinking of ways to do it. Realizing you can't do much better than ask a question. For Stripe, it's things like, we have three meals a day at long tables where everyone can sit together, if you think about how much more human interaction happens with having these randomly mixed meals. It's vast, right? A whole list of things like that. I think that's the general framework.

甚至如果不做這樣的投資的話
就比較短視了
我認為這點很重要
這些問題在某種程度上
挺簡單的
例如如何加強人與人之間的關係？
這件事我們每天都在做
在公司規模擴大後如果使其係統與有效呢？
公司小的時候
是怎麼做的如何解決問題的
其實可以當做公司擴大後的做法
的粗略模型
比如說一個增長迅速的公司
員工數一年增長兩三倍是不正常的
管理該時期的增長
最不差的方法是什麼呢？
人事組織也不是以此為前提的
能夠系統考慮此類問題
是很值的
要意識到你或許永遠做不到足夠
我們Stripe
一日三餐我們在一個大桌子上吃
所有人都能坐得下
有各種各樣的食物
你想想大家會有多少交流
很多
事情差不多是這樣的
差不多就是這樣的情況
Ben Silbermann: One thing I'm really curious about. You guys value transparency. Have you scaled it over time? I know with us, we think about it all the time. Just curious.
我很好奇你們關於“透明”的觀念
這一理念是如何隨著公司發展而發展的？
我比較好奇這是怎麼一回事
Patrick Collison: Startups, I can't remember who defined it as, a startup is an organization that is not yet stuck with all these principal agent problems. That large companies, what is locally optimal for you frequently is not what is globally optimal for the company. As a consequence of that, a reason a startup can just work differently than a big company, at a big company, a lot of the things that are good for you, you couldn't do them in a completely transparent environment because people would think less of you. But because everyone is rolling in the same direction, a startup, you can kind of make all the information transparent. Like I said earlier, Stripe used to bcc us to be on every email unless you opted out of it. We thought that would be more efficient, you wouldn't need to have as many meetings if you could keep abreast of what is happening. And over time, we sort of built an interesting framework of mailing lists. We now have a program for generating gmail filters. For a rocky path of fifty people or so to Ben's point of asking people how they are getting along after several days. They all reported terrible because they couldn't find all the emails people were sending to them. They were missing things and everything.
你知道在創業公司
我忘了是誰說的了
有人把創業公司定義為不被原則問題困擾的公司
在成熟的大公司中
對你個人有好處的事情
往往對公司則是不好的
那麼結果就是
可能在創業公司
很多做事的方式就會與大公司完全不同
在大公司中很多事情對你有好處--
嗯你不能在大公司把所作的事情都透明化
對吧？
因為這樣別人會看不起你
或者認為你無法勝任所做的工作
但在創業公司中
大家都是一條船上的
你就可以把所有信息都透明化
我之前提到過
在Stripe
所有郵件都會密送給其他人
除非你退出
因為我們覺得這樣更有效率
這樣你就可以隨時知道發生了什麼
而不用整天開會
隨著時間的推移
我們的郵件列表不斷擴大
現在我們還做了一個Gmail過濾器的程序
在剛開始的困難時期
就如Ben說的
問一下員工最初的使用感受
他們都感覺很糟糕
因為很難找到
別人發給​​他的郵件
因此錯過了很多事情
John Collison: Gmail broke at one stage.
Gmail會崩潰
Patrick Collison: Right, right. At one point Gmail broke because we were sending too much email. It is hard to scale because you might contact somebody out of the company with some great idea. The person sitting across the way from you thinks it's the stupidest thing they have ever heard. You are kind of under that scrutiny of the whole organization in some degree with all your communication. That's the challenging side, that people more formally know what's happening. I don't feel I can give a stronger endorsement of it than it has worked so far. I really am curious how it will work when we are five thousand people, if we are ever at that scale.
對有時Gmail會崩潰
因為我們的郵件發的太多了
但這種方式很難擴展
有時你有一個好的想法
需要和公司以外的人聯繫
但那個人可能覺得
你這個想法實在太差了
那這時你們所有的對話
都會被整個公司的人看到
這對你來說是一種挑戰
但這種機制的好處就是大家都能知道
正在發生的事情
我感覺這方法目前運行的非常不錯
不能更好了
確實不錯
實際上我也很好奇公司有5000人的時候
這個方法還行不行

John Collison: I think a couple things that helped us scale it, is we changed tools in changing the culture around it. On the tools front it use to be the case you could keep abreast of what's happening in the company by reading all the email. Now we weekly all hands on deck. We actually have to put all this work into communicating what is going on in this company. Since there is so much more. The second is, cultural side so much information in terms. You have to create social norms around it. Obvious things such as what is confidential to Stripe. Less obvious things, like when emailing someone or talking in Slack or IRC that is now viewed by one hundred seventy people, it's pretty easy to get stage fright. And it's pretty easy with what you thought was a reasonable proposal, you get this drive by criticism and you are less likely to share in the future. We have had to create norms around when it is okay to jump into discussions and how that interaction works because people are around the stage much more.
如果我們能達到那個規模的話
我認為有兩點可以幫助我們擴大規模
一是改變工具二是對於工具要保持公司的文化
可能這個工具
之前可以接收
並閱讀公司的所有郵件
是一個保持信息透明化的基礎工具
但現在可能我們每週會開例會
我們需要通過這種方式
來交流公司都發生了什麼事情
因為公司現在事情多了很多
其二關於文化方面
公司內部的信息非常多
你必須制定一個文化準則
其中很明顯的一點就是
有些信息是機密的
還有一點就是你通過Slack或者IRC發郵件的時候
差不多有170個人都會看到
很容易讓人感到怯場
很可能發生的事情是
本來你的建議很好
但有人批評了兩句
下次你就不敢再說了
所以我們必須制定準則
什麼時候參與討論比較合適
以及如何交互工作
因為員工們的工作越來越多

Patrick Collison: I'm sure it's not good to put anyone on the spot, but Emily interned at Stripe this summer. I am curious, as an intern. what you thought of it.
可能我這樣做不太好
也許會讓她成為眾矢之的Emily這個夏天在Stripe實習
我很好奇你作為實習生是怎麼想的？
Emily: Overall it's great. The first week, I spent most of my time reading Hackpad trying to get caught up on what the company was doing. It can often be quite distracting from your own work as often times there are other parts of the company that you are interested in.

Patrick Collison: Hackpad, by the way, is like Google Docs but with a news feed, where you can see all the documents.

Emily: And you are encouraged to make everything public, everything that you work on. But overall it gets you sped up rather quickly. There are these things called Spin Ups, where every leader of the team gives a thirty minute talk on what they are doing and how you can contribute if you are interested.
我感覺很不錯
在我剛來的第一周
基本上都在Hackpad閱讀協作文檔
了解同事們都在幹什麼
可能這樣做會經常讓你分心
無法專注於自己的工作
因為那上面能看到公司其他部門很多有意思的事情
順便說一下Hackpad就類似於Google Docs
但上面有動態消息你可以看到所有的文檔
對的你是鼓勵我們把正在做的事情
都公開化的
這樣工作速度可以提高不少
同時我們還有個叫“自旋向上”的做法
公司裡面的每一個領導
要用30分鐘的時間講解團隊的工作
以及你對這件事情感興趣的時候
如何做出貢獻
Patrick Collison: Do you think transparency was that good?
你認為郵件透明化的做法好嗎？
Emily: Yes, I remember having a hard time remembering what I should and should not subscribe to. The first week having two thousand emails in my inbox, then by the end there are three or four teams you want that information coming up from.
對我一開始對於該做什麼
不該做什麼傷透了腦筋
第一周我差不多收到了2000封郵件
但後​​來就只剩下三四個你感興趣的團隊了
只需要對這些團隊進行跟踪即可
Sam Altman: So this question is for Patrick and John. Have the people that you hired early been able to grow up into leadership roles?
下面我們回答下同學們的問題
請講
這個問題是問Patrick和John的
根據你們的經驗
早期的員工能發展成為公司的管理者嗎？

還有一個問題是問Ben的
你認為
你們現在的產品和聽眾
與剛開始的時候有什麼不同？

好先回答第一個
事實上希望你們三個都來說一下
早期你的僱員在後來能成為
管理者嗎？
John Collison: In Stripe's case yes. A lot of the first ten people are in leadership roles now. I think that's one thing that corporations, it's an unnatural skill that they need to get good at. People don't exactly come out of the womb being good at management or at leadership. And being able to develop that in people and helping people progress as they spend a number of years at the company, it's a lot of work when people are running around with their hair on fire. But it's also damaging if the company can't develop that skill.
在Stripes是這樣的
我們最早的10個員工現在很多都成為了管理者
我想關於管理這件事情
人們不是天生就會管理的
大家要意識到我們不是一生下來
就會管理就可以成為領導的
要獲得這種能力
公司必須花費數年時間
來幫助他們進步
這通常需要花很多精力
因為公司會不斷有人事變動
但如果員工沒有獲得這樣的能力對公司損害也很大

Ben Silbermann: I think for us the answer is some yes and some no. I think one of the benefits of working at a startup is you can be handed a challenge no one else would be crazy enough to let you take on. And that could be managing people, it could be taking on a project. And also if you ask someone to take a risk like that, it shouldn't be one way through the door if you don't succeed. Otherwise it creates fear to give it a shot. So we have some folks managing a large team at the start, individual programmers, individual engineers. And they say, Hey I would love to try leading a project, leading a group, then taking responsibility for management. Then we have other folks that try it and are really glad they did so they know they never want to do that again. We try that, for those people, you can have just as much impact on the company through your individual contributions as an engineer or what have you. But it's really hard to predict unless you give people a shot. So my strong preference is you give as many people a shot as possible. And in the few areas where you feel there is too much of a learning curve relative to the business development you are trying to achieve, that is when you look for someone who might walk in and really execute well on the job.
嗯對於我們來說有些可以有些不行
我認為在創業公司工作的一個巨大的好處就是
你可以接受挑戰
成為一個管理者
這是其他地方得不到的
在這你可以管理其他人
或者帶一個項目
但這裡的隱性合約是
如果你讓某人承擔巨大的風險去進行管理
也不應該讓他一條路走到黑一旦不能成功
就會造成恐慌
我們有些程序員會嘗試著
去管理一些很多人的團隊
這些工程人員很樂意去嘗試
帶一個項目領導一個團隊
管理整個隊伍並為其負責
當然也有另外一批人嘗試過後
覺得還是更喜歡做原來的工作
這樣我們就知道對於那些人來說
做一個工程人員或者設計者
也是可以對公司產生很多貢獻的
不一定非要管理
但沒嘗試過就很難確定他適不適合
所以我的傾向是
盡量讓員工多去嘗試
在一些領域當中
為了尋找能完成你的商業目標的人
需要付出很多嘗試
這就是你在尋找
可以勝任某項工作的人的時候需要做的事情

第二個問題是
從創業開始我們的願景是如何改變的
So the question was, has the vision changed since we initially started?


A:


 Well I think on the vision, when we first started hiring, we were like we are going to build this really cool tool, people are going to enjoy it. I like collecting things, maybe others like collecting things. And what we didn't expect that revealed itself early on, was that looking at other peoples collections was, it turned out to be this really amazing way of discovering things you didn't know you were looking for. It becomes a solution to the problem that a lot of other technologies don't have.

我們最開始創業時
進行的招聘是很具有誘導性的
我們要做一個很酷的工具
人們肯定會喜歡
我喜歡蒐集一些東西
也許其他人也喜歡
在早期
我們沒有料到的事情是
在看其他人的蒐集品的過程中
我們也會發現自己沒有意識到的
正在尋找的東西
這讓我們解決了很多
通過其他技術無法解決的問題

Over the last year we have poured a lot of resources into building our recommendation products, search products, feed products. Leveraging the unique data that we have, which are these pins that were all picked by someone and hand categorized. And the on the audience side, I think the first big surprise was truthfully when we first started, we didn't know if anyone would really use it. eE were just happy that anybody who wasn't related to us or obligated would use it. The biggest surprise has been the diversity of people and how diverse those groups have been. And I think that's been one of the things that's the most exciting. And the funny thing is, often as the company goes further along your aspirations get bigger. There is this gap that exists, and I tell my team, between where we are and we should be. Objectively we are further along, I feel the gap has widened. But I think that's a really common trait among people who found companies.
因此在過去的幾年中
我們投入了很多精力和資源
去打造一些推薦、
搜索和流推送的產品
我們利用了我們手工收集和分類的
大量的獨有的數據來做產品
對於用戶這邊來說
我們第一次把產品上線的時候感到非常吃驚
因為我們不知道會不會有人來用它
令我們感到高興的是和我們沒什麼關係的人
當然也不是被強迫使用它的親戚這些人也開始使用它
給我們最大的驚喜是有非常多的人
各種各樣的人都在使用它
我想這是非常激動人心的一件事
有趣的是
當公司不斷發展的時候
我們的願望也隨之變大
中間總有差距存在
我告訴團隊我們現在在哪裡目標又在哪裡
即使客觀來說我們有了很大的進步
但我感覺理想和現實的差距更大了
但我想這是創業者都會經歷的
一件事情
Sam Altman: So the question is, most start ups are not the iPhone. You can't guarantee that most people's grandchildren are going to remember this because most startups fail. How do you convince people to make sacrifices to do join a startup?
當你描述公司美好願景的時候
也不得不講明其中的困難
比如可能3年內會見不到家人
但他們也會因此獲得
可以讓後輩驕傲的東西
但你怎麼知道？
Patrick Collison: I think part of why it resonates with people is because it's not guaranteed. If it was it would be boring. There is the prospect of affecting this outcome, but nothing more than that potential. As far as not seeing their families and kids, startups do involved longer hours in the beginning but I think that story is overstated. Even the startups that in the earlier days had some sort of longer working days, have a tendency to exaggerate. It's kind of like the startup version of fishing. Every startup thinks they worked more insane hours than the next one back in the early days. It's like we literally never slept for two years. I think realistically for most people, it's not that big of a sacrifice. I think on average, people work on average two hours more a day. It is a sacrifice but it is not forgoing all pleasure and enjoyment for the next half decade.
你們都知道
後者是無法保證的
如果他們這兩年都見不到家人
事情就會變得完全不一樣
那麼在描述美好願景的時候
你如何保證他們的高風險投入
能夠獲得相應的回報？
好問題
那麼他問的是
不是每個公司都能做出iPhone
你不能保證讓你的後輩知道你的光輝事蹟
因為大多數創業都是以失敗告終
你如何說服人們犧牲自己
從而加入你的創業團隊？
我覺得其中一點是
正因為沒有保證才能在人們心中產生共鳴
什麼都設計好了就沒意思了
對於最後的結果雖然具有不確定性
但創業的確是潛力無限的
對於見不到家人這點
創業公司確實在起步階段需要加班
但我想
好幾年見不到家人這種說法還是太誇張了
我猜Scott Forestall一定很願意
招這些人過來
但我的意思是
即使是在早期的創業公司
可能每天工作的時間比較長
但人們總有誇大這一現象的傾向
總是會說一些不找邊際的話
每個創業公司的人都認為
自己在越來越瘋狂的工作
比如我們有時聲稱兩年來都沒怎麼睡覺
嗯那麼
我認為對大多數人來說
不需要有那麼大的犧牲
也許平均來說這個我必須實話實說
可能每天要多工作兩個小時
創業確實需要一點犧牲但也沒那麼誇張
不需要犧牲掉你五年中的所有放鬆和娛樂項目

Ben Silbermann: Even the iPhone wasn't the iPhone before it got done. No smart person you are hiring thinks you have a crystal ball into the future that only you have and that joining is a guaranteed thing. And in fact if you are telling them that and they select in, maybe you shouldn't be hiring them because they didn't pass a basic intelligence test of certainty and the future. But I think it's fair to say what's exciting and where you think you can go. And where it's going to be hard and chart your best plan. And then tell them why their role in it can be instrumental because it is.
我想說的是iPhone在面世之前
也沒人知道它會這麼成功
也不會有人傻到認為
只有你有個能預見未來的水晶球
然後充滿信心的加入你
如果你那麼一胡扯他就加入了
那你真不應該僱他
因為這樣的人
對於未來最基本的不確定性都不明白
我認為比較好的說法是
告訴他們公司想要做什麼
會有什麼困難以及自己的計劃
然後告訴他們為什麼他們的加入
是非常有意義的
I really liked what you said, if you tell people, Hey we are going to go to Mars, it attracts the best people and you are closer to Mars and they know that. What I would discourage is whitewashing all that. And if people are joining because they want all the certainty of Google and the perk of working in a small startup with more email transparency, then that's a really negative sign. For example, when I interview people, they often say, I'm really passionate about what you are doing. I often ask where else they are interviewing. If they list seven companies that have nothing to do with each other, except they are at the same stage, I love the stage of discovery, so I'm interviewing at Stripe, Jawbone, Airbnb, Uber, I'm also putting my resume into Google X, that's a sign they are probably not being authentic, which you care about. And those folks, when things get hard, they won't stick it out and work through it, because they were really signing up for an experience, not for achieving a goal.

我很喜歡你剛才說的
如果你跟別人說嘿我們要上火星
這能吸引最優秀的人
那麼你離這個目標就更近了
他們都知道自己在做什麼
我不鼓勵的是把一切都掩蓋住
如果人們是因為能夠得到保障而加入
就像在Google工作那樣
並且還有小創業公司的那種感覺
以及透明化的郵件系統
那就不是一件好事情了
比如說我在招聘的時候應聘者總會說
哎呀我對你們做的東西很感興趣啊
這時我通常會問他們你還面試過什麼公司
然後他們就會說出7家公司的名字來
這些公司除了處於發展的同一階段外沒有任何相似之處
他們會說
我喜歡發現問題解決問題
所以我面試了Stripe Dropbox Airbnb 還有Uber
我還給Google X部門
投了簡歷
如果是這樣那基本上就表明了
他們沒說實話
對
這種人遇到困難的時候
不會堅持到底
因為他們只是想獲得經驗
而不是完成目標


Patrick Collison: I think the other thing that motivates people a great deal is the prospect of affecting some outcome, is just the personal development angle. And a startup because it's more lightly staffed it's much less forgiving. Whether or not you are the best or the worst person in the world, you are probably not going to alter Google's trajectory. Whereas if you really want to benchmark yourself and see how much of a contribution and impact you can make, the startup is a much better place to test that.
我想除了美好的前景以外
還有另一件事情可以激勵人們
那就是在創業公司自己的能力也可以得到發展
在創業公司中
由於員工人數不多
做錯事的後果比較嚴重
因為
即使你是世界上最優秀的人
如果你不--
不管你是世界上最好還是最糟糕的人
你都不可能
去改變Google的發展軌跡

但如果你想測試下自己的水平
看看你自己能做出多大的貢獻產生多少影響力
那麼我想對於優秀的人來說
加入創業公司
是一個非常不錯的檢驗自己的選擇
Sam Altman: How does your user base affect your hiring strategy?
你的用戶是如何影響你的招聘策略的？

Ben Silbermann: Conventional base, you only hire people who use your product religiously everyday. And that probably works well if you make an API. For us, we screen for people who have vision and discovery online. And they have to know how our service works, and they have to have used it. But they may not be a lifelong user. And for us that's great, we can ask what is the barrier that is preventing you from using it? Come join, we will move that barrier. Help us get closer to that vision. If you read a startup book, there is all this wisdom, but it is only useful if it works in your certain circumstance. So for us, we have had to broaden the lens a little bit and bring in people who are excited about the mission, that care about our product and our approach to building products. Even if from day one they weren't our earliest users.
Pinterest網站的用戶有八成是女性
這點如何影響你最初的招聘決定？
你的用戶是如何影響你的招聘策略的？
嗯好
通常來說你應該僱傭那些
每天使用你的產品的人
如果你正在處於做API的階段
效果會更好
對於我們來說我們要找的是
那些對於互聯網充滿雄心與激情的人
他們必須能準確的知道我們的服務如何運作
必須使用過我們的產品
但他們不必​​是終身用戶
因為這對我們來說也是個好機會
因為這樣我們可以了解到是什麼原因阻礙了他們繼續使用
加入我們解決這個問題
這樣我們就能朝著願景更進一步
這方面有很多書籍
如果你讀過的話
裡面有很多看上去很有道理的創業經
但只有在你的特定環境下可行那才是有用的
那麼對於我們來說我們需要把視野放寬些
尋找那些對於這個使命具有雄心壯志的人
它們必須關注我們的產品以及產品的開發方式
即便他們不是最初的用戶也沒問題

就這樣
謝謝你們今天能來

John Collison: The one thing I want to tack onto this is, we touched on it being hard to hire early on for those first employees, you have people with other options, you are very much at the ugly duckling stage. Hiring people who are passionate about your product is a great way to find people. You have a natural advantage over other companies. I know in Stripe's case, we hired four Stripe users, people who we probably couldn't have gotten otherwise. I'm sure it was the same in Pinterest's case where you will get all this benefit at working with Pinterest, like, Hey it's Pinterest.
我想補充的一點是
在創業的初期階段
招人是非常難的
因為他們通常會有其他好的選擇
你的公司還是個醜小鴨沒有變天鵝
尋找那些對你產品充滿激情的人
是個很好的招聘方式
通過這點
你就比別的公司更加有優勢
那麼對於Stripe來說
我們就僱傭了Stripe最早期的4位用戶
這樣的員工
是我們通過其他方法招不來的
我想在Pinterest肯定也一樣
在這裡你能得到所有的好處
因為這是Pinterest
你可以到你喜歡的產品的公司工作
Sam Altman: Thank you guys very much for coming in today.
