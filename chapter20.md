Lecture 20: Closing Thoughts and Later-Stage Advice 


大家午安。今天是“如何創業”最後一次講座了。今天的內容和原先不同，前面講的內容都是創業初期要幹的事。我們今天講的內容大家在短期內還不必考慮，應該說不用考慮。鑑於在大家的公司​​經歷市場需求考驗之前，我沒機會跟在座的大部分同學繼續分享了。我給大家列出來了一些，在創業公司擴張時要考慮的一些問題。很多創始人，在這些方面沒能很好地進行過渡。

ppt上列出來了今天的主要內容，列出來的問題不再是編程或與用戶交流。也就是說大家在產品能迎合市場之前，不必考慮今天所講的內容。通常在創業的第12個月到24個月，大部分這些問題的重要性開始顯現。不過只是一個特殊階段而已，此時公司差不多有25個人，而且產品經證明是符合市場需求的。

大家可以先記下這些問題，需要的時候回顧一下。我首先要說的是管理，在創業初期雖然沒什麼管理可言，此時公司運轉地也很好，在公司有20個或25個員工之前。所有員工都向創始人匯報工作，這樣很好也需要這樣。在創業初期對打造產品而言這是最好的模式，這是最高效的模式。


不過讓人苦惱的是，無管理的模式會瞬間崩塌。當公司有20個員工之前，還有效的模式，在有30個員工的時候就不行了。大家要留意這種轉變的發生。實際上大家不必整成很複雜的管理結構，應該說不要太複雜。大家要做的就是讓每個員工知道自己的管理人是誰，該向哪一個人匯報工作。而且每個管理人得明確自己負責哪些人。

理想情況下大家自然地聚合起來。最重要的是，要有明確的匯報機制。而且每個員工都清楚，如果要進行變動或招募新人，員工們要都知道。簡單清楚是最重要的，如果做不到這點公司會很慘。因為在創業初期沒什麼管理結構公司運營地很好，或是因為大家以沒什麼管理結構為傲。很多公司會想，嘗試“沒有管理結構”，這樣瘋狂的管理方法。大家在產品和商業模型上，可以盡可能創新，不過在管理結構上不要輕舉妄動。

不推薦大家在管理結構上“創新”，所以不要犯“無管理結構”這種錯誤，也不要犯“管理結構超級複雜”這種錯誤。很多人在這個地方犯錯，原因可能是大家覺得自己能當個經理是很爽的。如果只是個員工的話心裡不爽。所以就有人想出了，循環的管理結構，比如A向B匯報x事務，B向C匯報y事務，C又向A匯報z事務。這也是不好的，不要這麼做。從公司角度或從創始人職責角度來看，此時都是很重要的轉變時期。

在產品能迎合市場之前，首要的任務是打造好產品。隨著公司的發展，員工數增加到25個人了。創始人的首要任務從打造好產品，變成了打造好公司，這段時期的轉變決定了公司的未來。這應該算是，創始人要做的最大轉變了。


在創始人變成管理人的過程中，有四種常見的錯誤。我們來說說這四種最常見的錯誤：第一個是害怕招資歷深的人。在創業早期，招資歷深的人通常是不好的，因為此時只需要找人把東西做出來，此時工作努力和誠懇的態度，比經驗要重要。但是當公司開始擴張，要建立基本的管理結構了，此時招募資歷深的人是很有意義的。尤其是招一些有經驗的主管，幾乎所有的創始人，招募了優秀的主管後，主管接管了很大一部分工作。創始人都不禁感嘆：要是早點招就好了。很多人都會犯這種“過於等待”的錯誤，不要害怕招資歷深的主管。


第二個錯誤是英雄模式，用客戶服務負責人來舉例吧。客戶服務團隊負責人，想要以身作則這個出發點是好的。舉個極端點的例子，這個負責人想讓團隊成員都努力工作，不過他不是督促大家努力工作而是要樹立榜樣。他一天工作18個小時，他用實際行動告訴大家該如何把事情做好。不過隨著公司開始增長，他有點不情願把很多工作，交給他人來做。隨著公司不斷發展，工作量增大了。他得一天工作19個小時甚至得20個小時，這種做法顯然行不通。他不願停下來去招人，因為他覺得一旦耽誤一天，就會落下很多工作。要擺脫這種英雄模式，唯一方法是就得放下兩週或三週的工作。因為得出去，招募新的團隊成員。根據目前的增長算一下，就得花這麼長的時間招人。下次的時候我就不會犯這樣的錯誤了，得提前招人。


此時就得有所取捨，因為要出去招人，就得放下手頭的工作，這是正確的做法。錯誤的做法是沉溺於英雄模式以至於筋疲力盡。很多人都會犯這種錯誤。

第三個錯誤是不當授權，很多人創始人以前沒有管理過他人，當然也就沒有管理過經理了。舉個不當授權的例子：創始人把一個員工叫過來，吩咐員工去調研，並把數據和利弊反饋回來，創始人最後來做決定，並吩咐員工去實施。很多創始人就是這樣授權工作的，這種做法讓員工心裡不舒服，也對公司的增長不利。


稍微改變一下結果就會非常不同。創始人對員工說：你很聰明所以我才會僱你。我交給你一項工作有一些問題要注意一下，我的想法是怎麼樣的最終的決定權交給你，我100%信任你把最終的決定告訴我，這樣的授權方式才是行得通的。我覺得，因為喬布斯能輕鬆駕馭我前面說的方式，他自己來做決定，大家都聽他的。所有的創始人都覺得自己會是下一個喬布斯，很多人會嘗試第一種做法，不過對於99.9%的創始人來說第二種更好。


第四條涉及的是個人規範，在打造產品階段，在運營公司方面和向他人介紹產品方面，不需要太規範。如果沒能建立有效的個人規範系統，沒能建立機制來追踪自己的工作，和他人的工作。沒能跟進工作的話，今後會後悔莫及的。所以在公司開始擴張的時候，就建立這樣的機制是很重要的。

創始人多次跟我們說，他們後悔沒早做兩件事。就是寫下來，怎麼做和為什麼做。怎麼做和為什麼做是非常重要的。在公司早期，大家一起吃飯的時候，就可以跟員工講如何打造產品，如何提高效率，如何來做​​客戶支持等等。

公司變大了就沒法這樣做了，果你沒有寫下來大家只能口頭傳達了，如果能寫下來放到維基或其他大家都能看到的地方。創始人得制定規範，創始人寫下來的東西會成為公司的金科玉律，如果能讓大家都能學習這種規範，在公司有100人甚至1000人的時候，大家都會學習這種規範知道該怎麼做。

如果不寫下來的話，當新員工加入時，只能由人事經理或朋友們來口頭傳達給他們了。得寫下來如何做和為什麼做，為什麼做就體現了公司的價值觀。Brian Chesky曾講過這方面的內容，我所認識的所有創始人都希望自己能早點把如何做和為什麼做弄成書面規範。希望在公司增長的時候就規範下來，這樣的規範就成了公司的金科玉律。很多人做不到這一點如果你能做到，這就是你最大的優勢了。

下一條是HR，在創業初期可以很自然地，不用管HR這個問題，此時HR沒有編程和與用戶交流重要。不過一直不管這個問題就大錯特錯了。我覺得大部分創始人都忽略這個問題的原因是他們覺得HR就像電視劇中那樣可惡。做好HR不但不會拖公司後腿，還會促進公司成長。


大部分創始人一方面說，人才是公司最寶貴的資源，另一方面又說不需要HR。他們說的“不需要HR”，其實是指不需要糟糕的HR。優秀的HR有幾個要素，首先要有清晰的結構。Charlie曾講過這個問題。給員工提供一條職業發展途徑。最重要的一點是，業績反饋。

在公司初期，大家清楚該怎麼做。當公司增加到25人30人45人，大家就糊塗了反饋機制不必太複雜，可以非常簡單得有反饋機制，並且得經常反饋。員工得能很快知道他們做得怎麼樣，如果員工做的不好，得把他們開了。如果他們做得好，得有明確地和薪酬掛鉤。

下面要講的是薪酬，在創業早期，員工的薪酬是自己和創始人談的，到處都這樣。隨著公司的發展，設定薪酬雖然讓人不舒服，卻是很有意義。中級工程師的薪酬是這個標準，高級工程師的薪酬是那個標準，從這一等級跨到另一等級得怎麼做，這樣做比較公平。總有一天大家會知道別人的待遇，如果不公平的話公司會亂成一鍋粥。早點設定標準，既公平，又可以省去招聘時討價還價。

我覺得在HR方面，期權是很重要的。很多創始人給早期的員工很多期權，這是對的。不過我覺得，得持續給員工期權。很多投資者在這個地方，會給出錯誤的建議，不過YC除外。很多其他的投資人會給出錯誤的建議。你應該給員工很多期權，給出期權會稀釋大家的期權。

會稀釋創始人的期權也會稀釋投資者期權。創始人通常能明白這個道理，不過投資者通常很短視不願期權被稀釋。投資者會牢牢捍衛自己的期權。我們YC收集了一些數據，我們發現最成功的公司，投資者也做得很好。這些公司不斷地給員工股份。


我會這樣跟創​​始人講，你得考慮在未來十年，每年給員工3-5%的股份。因為公司越來越大嘛，雖然你佔的股份比例變少了。但是綜合來看錢變多了。我覺得給期權這個事很重要，如果你重視員工的話就得這麼幹。而且得持續這麼做。得在早期就做好計劃，你應該不希望，員工在四年的股份兌現期中兌現完前三年的股份時。就準備離開公司吧。創始人要在員工兌現股份之前，就得計劃好新的股份分配方案。


有很多現成的員工股份分配方案，我個人比較推崇六年分配一次兌現也要六年。因為公司需要逐步地發展，有一種金字塔式兌現方案兌現股份數量逐年增加。第四年可兌現的股份比第一年多得多，有很多方案可以採用。不過要持續地進行，同樣數目的股票。大家的錢能逐年增多，無論採用哪種方案，都要建立相應的管理系統。常用的就是Excel表格形式。很多人在這點上犯錯，讓公司蒙受上千萬美元的損失。有很多方案可以選用，要製定好股份管理機制。


關於HR再說一點，在公司有50人時要改變一些做法，常見的是要開始性騷擾防范培訓，和多元化培訓還有其他的東西。要記住，在公司有50人時，要製定新的HR規定。


防止團隊筋疲力盡。在產品迎合市場階段要全力衝刺，此時公司的發展像跑馬拉松，此時不需要員工，一周工作100小時。得讓員工能輕鬆愉悅，讓員工迎接新挑戰做新東西。一旦整個公司筋疲力盡了，公司也就完了。

此時也是公司啟動招聘的契機。很多創始人後悔，公司走上正軌時沒有及時招聘，要有人全職負責招聘。太早做也不好，招的太快對公司也不好。大部分創始人在這一點上沒做好，給講大家一些招聘技巧。


比如即使公司達到300-400人時，也應該在招聘決定做出之前，通過公司內部電子郵件先公佈入選人名單。因為很多時候，公司的一些員工會知道人選的一些情況。採用這種方法的公司，對招到的新員工都非常滿意，得有幫助新員工融入公司的方案。新人入職，他們第一周怎麼樣呢？適應的怎麼樣？他們學的怎麼樣呢？有幫助他們的朋友嗎？有相應的機制會讓員工更好融入公司。

在公司創立一年或二年時，要考慮團隊多樣性這一問題。當公司團隊，只有15-20人時。大家都非常熟悉，公司文化自然生成。大部分創始人在這個地方犯過錯，他們後悔在公司初期沒能僱一些見解不同的人。不只是工程團隊有這個問題，不過這個問題在工程團隊尤為突出，如果在創業早期就能有這樣的遠見，公司在後期會發展得更快。


另一個要思考的問題是，公司早期員工的發展。常見的問題是，在公司早期招聘了一位很優秀的工程師。隨著工程團隊壯大需要VP工程師，早期的工程師希望成為VP工程師，你不想讓他擔任但是也不想早期的工程師離開。他們對公司很重要，很多員工喜歡他們。我覺得創始人得提早考慮好得考慮好隨著公司的發展，最初的10-15個員工，將何去何從。跟他們好好交流一下，開門見山地講，跟他們坐下來聊聊，問問他們的想法。


下面說一下公司效率問題，在創業初期不用考慮這個問題。通常小團隊的效率，都是很高的。隨著公司發展員工數目增加，如果不花點心思的話，效率會下降。如果把溝通想成是兩點之間的連接的話，結點增加了溝通困難了。如果不提前想好，當公司有25-50名員工時，讓公司保持效率的策略，公司很快就運轉不動了。

公司在壯大的過程中保持高效的關鍵是協同，公司效率低下的原因是員工步調不一致。什麼事要優先對大家而言是不一樣的，或是大家對著幹，這樣更糟糕。能夠讓員工朝著同一個方向前進，就成功一半了。要做到這點，首先要有明確的目標和方向，所有員工應該清楚未來3~6個月甚至一年裡公司的發展方向。具體時間多長取決於公司的發展週期。

我喜歡用一個經典方法來測試，一家公司是否面臨效率低下問題。我會問創始人：如果在公司裡隨便挑10個員工，問他們公司最重要的三個目標。他們能給出同樣的答案嗎？創始人100%都說會。

100%的情況下甚至沒人按順序說出公司最重要三個目標，創始人不相信。因為他們已經宣布未來三個月的目標了，他們怎麼能忘記呢？要不斷提醒員工，公司的方向和目標，幾乎沒有創始人能做得夠好。如果能經常提醒，大家都會知道公司的目標，並且把目標實現，目標把大家凝聚在一起。如果員工不清楚公司方向和目標，目標就不可能實現。

我們前面提到如何樹立公司價值觀。我再強調一下，價值觀有助於公司做出正確的決定，如果所有員工都知道思考框架，他們很可能做出同樣的決定，公司要靠好產品來生存而不是靠流程。這兩者之間有細微的差距。要有一定的流程，但是不要變本加厲，公司要時刻圍繞開發好產品。很多公司都嘗試過一個簡單方法：每天都要取得進展。

這種做法至少可以讓大家專注產品進展，溝通的透明度和節奏。非常重要很多公司拖了很久才這樣做，每週開管理團隊例會，這些人直接向創始人或CEO匯報工作
。頻率多少最合適是不一定的，至少每月一次會上要匯報工作進展強調公司發展方向。每季度做一份計劃，安排好未來三個月要完成的任務。季度目標要服務於全年目標，這點很重要。

我列出來“Offsite”。因為我覺得大家做得不夠，我們投資的很大一部分成功的公司，都把會議地點安排在公司之外。比如周末把公司最優秀的員工，帶到某個林中小屋之類的地方一起討論，公司以後要變成什麼樣子？我們要做的最重要的事情是什麼？什麼事情我們應該做但還沒做？把員工帶出辦公室是個好主意，我知道的這麼做的人都一致認為值得這麼做。

這些提高公司效率的計劃，為的是可以在相當長的一段時間內，建立一個有價值的公司。長時間是這裡的關鍵所在，你不能躲著這些問題，然後用你作為創始人的權威，只能保證公司的下一個策略是正確的。這樣做不能保證你後面的第十個第十一個決定的正確性。我認為創立一家公司最難的事情就是持續地保持創新。並且隨著公司的增長一直保持優秀的文化。大多數公司都是在這一步倒下的，大多數公司都是在創始人的努力下做出了一件好產品，但後​​續的產品就沒有創新了。所以創始人一定要好好想想，第二件產品要怎麼做，像蘋果那樣，在30或40年甚至更長的時間裡，一直推出偉大的產品是件很難的事情。


好了這就是一些提高效率的戰略，你只需要把它們記下來，以後用到的時候拿出來看看就行了。在創業初期人們幾乎不找會計，如果幸運的話能攢一鞋盒的收據，他們肯定也不會有諸如財務報表之類的東西。但等公司走上正軌，比如18個月後就是做這件事情的好時機了，你可以把這個業務外包出去。比如說：招人去記賬，完成每年的審計，你們可以和會計事務所合作，很簡單也很值得去做。


這也是個收集法律文件的好時機。這是一個彌補過去造成的混亂的時機。如果你讓其他人去做這件事情，去收集公司所有簽過的協議，如果有一天房東要把你趕出去的時候，沒人知道租賃合同在哪。也許有時負責這事的人能找到，通常來說你肯定會丟點兒東西。比如有的僱員沒簽保險合同之類的，這時你就能發現了。這是個彌補問題的好時機，等公司快要開始下一輪融資的時候，做這件事情就變得比較困難了。所以這個時候，是整理混亂的好時機。


創始人基金股是為創始人設立的，可以在後輪融資中拋售的一種股票，這樣做不會影響公司的股票估價。之前創業者通常在成立公司的時候，就設立創始人基金股，專門為創始人準備的錢，這就是它為什麼叫創始人基金股。但這是個很不好的信號，當公司倒閉的時候創始人就會只顧及自己的資金，設立創始人基金股的公司大多數都失敗了。所以投資人認為在種子輪融資就設立創始人基金股，是一個非常不好的信號，絕大多數創業者，在公司的價值沒超過10億左右時，是不會把公司賣掉的。因此我認為比較安全的做法是，在公司正常運轉後在下一輪融資時再設立創始人基金股，然後你可以在兩年三年四年後把這些股票賣掉。大家需要記住，在B輪融資的時候再做這件事情。

"FF Stock" is a special class of stock for founders that founders can sell in a later round without messing up the common stock valuation. It used to be that most people set this up right when they started the company. Founders fund sort of popularizes which is why it's called FF stock. But it became a really bad signal. Right that were obsessed with their own personal equity when the company had nothing - turned out to fail most of the time. So investors learned if founders pushed on this in the seed round, it was a very, very bad sign. Most founders don't actually want to sell stock until the company is worth like a billion dollars or something like. You can actually safely set this up after things start working in the next financing round and then you can sell it two, three, four years down the road. But it's a good thing to remember by around the time you get to the B round.

"IP, Trademarks and Patents". Actually just IP and trademarks. So, you have twelve months after you announce something if you want to patent it. And if you miss that window, it's very hard to do. So eleven months after launch or first publically talk about what you're doing - is a good time to file provisional patents. We recommend people just file provisional patents. All that does is hold your place in line at the patent office, and it gives you another year to decide if you want to patent something or not. It only costs about 1000 dollars. It takes way less effort than a full patent. And most of the time you'll know whether or not you'll need a fully patent a year later. But if you just do this one step, you'll at least have the option.

It's also a good time to file trademarks for the US and major international markets. Again, if you don't do this at this stage - most people end up regretting it. And while you're at it - a good time grab all the domains.

FP&A -- good time, also to think about someone to start doing FP&A. Most companies don't end realizing where they knobs on their financial model are until far too late. It turns out that if you have someone build a really great model of the business - and by really great, apparently Roelf Botha - who was the PayPal CFO and built their FP&A model - the top, like the top sheet of his spreadsheet was 15 hundred lines just a level of the detail people build these to. But you can really optimize the business and understand it at a level that most people totally miss. Most people don't hire someone like this until their many hundreds of employees. It's worth hiring earlier.

Another thing that I think is worth hiring earlier that almost no one does is a full time fundraiser. Let's say you hire someone really, really great and their full time job is to raise money for the company. You hire them after your B round. And you say, "You know what? By the time we raise our C round, we want the valuation be double what it would have been otherwise." You almost certainly get better results than if you hire an investment banker or someone else if it’s just someone internal with the company. And you end up paying way less money and take literally half the dilution. This is one these slightly non-obvious optimization that people just fail to make.

"Tax structuring". This is another thing. Once things are working it would be worth you spending a little bit of time thinking about how you set up the tax structure for the company. I confess I don't know a lot about the details here 'cause I just find it personally really boring. But like if you assign the IP to some corporation in Ireland that licensing it back to the US Corporation. You end up paying no tax. No corporate tax. But I know that you can only do that relatively early on. And this ends up being a huge issue for companies that don't do it that compete with companies that do it you know once they're big public companies. So that's worth doing.

A lot of people through the class have talked about "Your own Psychology" as a founder. Here's what they haven't said. It gets worse. Not better. As the company grows you continue to osculate. The highs are better but the lows keep getting worse. And you really want to think about this early on and just be aware that this is going to happen. And try to, try to manage your own psychology through the expanding swing that it's going through.

Another thing that happens as you begin to be successful as you go from being someone that most people rooted for - kind of the underdog. To someone that a lot of people hating on. You see this first in internet commenters who will be like, "I can't believe this shitty company raised money. It fucking sucks. It's like awful. And it only bothers you a little bit. But then journalists that you kind of care about it start writing this and it just goes on and on. This also will go on and on as you get more and more successful. You just have to make peace with this early. But if you don't it will bother you all the way through.

This is also a good time to start thing about how long of a journey this is going to be. Very few founders think long term. Most founders think kind of a year in advance and they think, "You know what? In three years I am going to sell my company and either I am going to become a VC or sit on the beach or something." Because so few people make an actual long term commitment to what they're building - the ones that do have a huge advantage. They're in a a very rare flight class. So this is a good time to sit around with your co-founders and decide, "You know what - we're going to work on this for a very long time and we're gonna build a strategy that assumes that we're going to be doing this for the next ten years." Just thinking that way alone, it's probably a very high leverage thing you can do for success.

Take vacation. Another common thing that we see is founders will run their business for three or four years without ever taking more of a day of vacation. And that works for a year or two years or something like that. It really leads to a nasty burn out.

Losing focus is another way that founders get off track. This is a symptom of burnout. When you get really burned out on running business you want to do easier things or sort of more gratifying things. You want to go to conferences and have people tell you how great you are. You know what to do all these things that are not actually building a business. And the most common post YC failure case for the companies we fund is that they are incredible focused during YC on their company - and then after, they start doing a lot of other things. They advise companies. They go to conferences. Whatever. Focus is what made you successful in the first place. There are a lot of reasons people lose focus. But fight against that really, really hard.

This is a special case of focus. As you start to do well - you will start to get a bunch of potential acquires sniffing around. And it's very gratifying. You're like, "Wow! I can be so rich." And I'll be so cool. And MNA negotiations feel really fun. This is one of the biggest killers of companies. Is that they entertain acquisition conversations. You distract yourself. You get demoralized if it doesn't happen. If an offer does come in - it's really low. You've already mentally thought that you're done and so you take the offer. As a general rule don't start any acquisition conversation unless you're willing to sell for a pretty low number. Don't ever just check it hoping that you're going to have the one miracle high offer. If that's going to happen you’ll know because they'll just make you a big offer before you can meet them. But this is big company killer.

And then - just a reminder to everybody - that things that kills startups at some level is the founders giving up. So sometimes you should quit but if you mismanage your own psychology and you quit when you shouldn’t, that is what kills companies. That is the final cause of death for most of these startups. And so if you can manage your own Psychology in a way that you don't quit - don't get to a place where you need to quit or give up on the startup. You'll be in a far far better place.

So "Marketing & PR" is something that we tell companies to ignore for a long time. Everyone thinks in the early days that the press is going to be what saves them. We tell them all the time it doesn't work that way. It’s definitely true. Press is not what's going to save your start up. But as you start to be successful - this is something that the founders themselves need to spend time on. So once your product is working - switch from not caring about this to caring about it a little bit. The two most important things for the founder to do - the founders to do - figure out the key messaging yourselves. Never outsource to your head of marketing or PR firm. You founders have to figure out what the message of the company is going to bet. And once you've set that it kind of sticks. Very hard to change this once the press decides how they’re going to talk about you.

The other thing is getting to know key journalists yourself. PR firms will always try to prevent you from doing this because they need to have a reason to to exist... And so they're like, "We're going to handle the relationship with the journalist. We'll just bring you in for interviews." No journalist wants to talk to a PR flag ever. They're so much happier to hear from to just hear from the founder. The biggest PR hack you can do is to not hire a PR firm. Just pick three or four journalists that you develop really close relationships with that like you. That understand you - which you get. Then you contact them yourself; they will cover every story you ever give them. And they'll actually pay attention and get to know you and care about the company. This is so much better than the normal strategy of having a PR firm blast 200 contacts that never read their emails with every piece of news. This is something that I think is important to start doing.

This is also the time in a company when business development starts to matter. And so in the early days you can basically ignore anything that would be like doing deals. Except maybe fundraising and sales. This is a time when they're important. And everything or many things that you do like even fundraising. It falls under the category of doing deals.

So there are - here’s my one minute crash course on this. There are five points that are important to understand here. We've talked about this a lot. Nothing will matter if you don't "Build a great product". So assume that you've done this before you go try to get anyone to do anything with you.

"Developing a personal connection" with anyone you're trying to do any sort of big deal with is really important. For whatever reason, most founders fail to this. Or many founders fail to do this. But no one wants to feel like they're this transactional thing. That you're using them to get distribution for your product or to raise money or whatever. So figuring out some way to actually care about this person and care about what you're doing with them. And not view them - you brave to in your own mind not just view them as this one off transaction. You have to actually care about them and what they're going to get out of this.

"Competitive dynamics" - this is a basic principal of negotiation. Most founders learn this the first time in fundraising. But it actually matters for everything. The way you get deals done and the ways you get good terms is to have a competitive situation. You don't do this deal with party A, you're going to do it with party B. It's not always an option but it usually is. And this is the single thing that makes deals happen and makes deals move.

Tyler talked about "Persistence" -- the last lecture. So I won't hit on that again too much other than to say you go beyond your comfort point here most of the time as a founder.

And then the fifth point is that "You have to ask for what you want". This is another thing - I still have trouble with this and certainly most of the founders we do have. If you want something in a deal - just ask for it. Most of the time, you won't get laughed out of the room and might get it. But you have to be - at some point, you actually have to say, "You know this is what I'd like to do." Even if it feels aggressive or an over-reach or whatever.

So I am going to close this part of the talk with an image. One of the Airbnb founders drew this on like a business card or something for another founder that starting a company and then I saw it once and took a picture of it. 'Cause I thought it was such a good summary. And what he had tried to draw here was the YCombinator process as he remembers it. I love it 'cause it’s like so simple and it looks so doable when it’s written on a business card. But you're trying to find product market fit. You're trying to build a product and you're trying to close the gap between those two gears. The only way to do that is to go off and meet the people. You can't do this without getting really, really close to your users. And then he drew this graph that sort of on a white board that at YC and gotten kind of sort one of the YC rites of passage. But that's the graph of how adoption goes for a new company.

So you launch on the press. You get a huge spike. It falls off to nothing. At some point at least one point things look like they're going to completely die and kind of dip below the X access. They recover a little bit, you have this long, long troth of sorrow before things work. In Arabian B's case, it was a thousand days before the graph started taking upward. You have these wiggles of false hope. And then finally, finally, finally, finally things start to grow. Three years later. So starting a startup ends being this very long process. It is - it can be very rewarding. It's definitely long but it is doable. That's what I love about that drawing.

So with that. I have about ten minutes left. I can questions on this or anything else in the course that we've covered. If anyone has some.

Yes.

Audience member #1: You hold that diversity is important, but an earlier speaker said that diversity wasn't important and that you should just hire people that are very much like you and trust you...


Sam: So the question is how you square the device of diversity being important with earlier speakers saying that you want people that are very similar.

The difference is that what you want is diversity of backgrounds. But you don't want diversity of vision. Like where companies get in trouble is when they have people that think very differently about what the company should be doing or don't work well together. You don't want that. You do want hire people that you know and that you trust and that you can work with, but if everyone on the team comes from exactly the same background you do end up developing somewhat of a monoculture. Which often causes problems down the road. Not always. Some companies have been successful with that.

So what we tell people is hire people that you know and that you've worked with before. But try to hire people that complementary and aligned towards the same goal. Not people that are exactly the same. 'Cause you just get a better skill set.

Audience member #2: So what are some examples of ways to make up productivity on a personal level? How do you do that on a personal level and also on an advance level?

Sam: How to keep track productivity systems. So, the one I use which I actually thinks works really well is I keep one piece of paper with my goals for sort of three to twelve month time frame. And I look at that every day. And then separately I keep one page for every day of my short term goals for that day. And so if I need to do something in like a week I just flip forward seven pages and I write down. And then I also keep a list of every person and what they're working on and what I need to tell them and what I need to talk to them about. What we talked about last time. So every time I sit down with someone I kind of the full state and a list of things for that person that works really well.


Audience member #3: So we talked a lot about the startups growing but most startups fail. Any advice for how to fail gracefully?


Sam: Yeah. Yeah. Great question. We should have covered that.


How to fail gracefully. So, most startups fail and Silicon Valley almost goes too far on how it loves failure. Failure still sucks. You should still try not to fail. And this whole like thing of like "Ahh failure is great!" I don't agree with, but it will happen to most people most of the time and it's a very forgiving environment. As long as you are up front about it and ethical and don't let anyone get into bad situation. So if you're failing, first of all you should tell your investors, and second of all, you should not totally run out of money. What you don't want is blow up which a bunch of depths that the company owe and everyone showing up to work one day and the door being locked.

You'll know when you're failing and you'll know the company - things just aren't going to work. And you should just tell you investors, "Like hey. Sorry. This isn't going to work." No one will be surprised. Like I expect to lose my - or I'm willing to lose my money on every investment I ever I make. I know that happens most of the time and the winners pay for it you know still with a factor of a hundred. And so it's ok, No one - people will be very understanding and supportive. But you want to tell people early. You don't want to surprise them. And you want - you don't want to like let your employees get shocked when they know they don't have job. You want shut the company down in a graceful way. Help them find jobs. Make sure you give the two or four weeks of severance payment so they're not suffering a cash flow problem. All that stuff is pretty important.


Audience member #4: How many immigrant founders have you seen in YCombinator?


Sam: How many immigrant founders have we seen in YCombinator? In the last batch - I think it probably went up for this next batch. In our last batch 41 percent of the founders we founded we're born outside the US. From thirty different countries. So it's a pretty big percentage.


Audience member #4: I was just thinking - what do you think are the good places to start start ups?


Sam: Apart from the Valley where do I think are other good places to start a startup. Well I still think the Valley is the best by a very significant margin. But I think it's finally maybe beginning to weaken a little bit because the costs have just gotten out of control. To be clear - if I was going to start a company I still wouldn't think about it. I still will pick Silicon Valley. And think if you look at the data of companies of over the last few years that is to wins by a lot. But Seattle, LA - Lots of places outside the US - I think all of these makes sense.

Audience member #4: Like places outside the US?

Sam: I hesitate to make recommendations because I haven't spent enough time in the cities to really have an intuitive feel. But like - you know as well as I do the common ones people talk about start up hubs. I just can't make a personal recommendation there.

Audience member #5: So when should the founders start to thinking about hire a professional CEO - a senior guy?

Sam: When should the founders think about hiring a professional CEO? Never. You - if you look at the most successful companies in tech they are run by their founders for a very long time. Sometimes forever. Sometimes they even hire professional CEO and realize that is not going to like build a great company and so Larry Page came to be CEO again. I think if you don't want to be the long term CEO of a company - you probably shouldn't start one. I am not totally sure about that. I think there are exceptions. But generally that the transition that I talked about today if you go from build ing a great product to building a great company being a founder for nine of the ten years is going to be about building that great company and if you're not excited about doing that - I think you should think hard about it.

Audience member #6: What are some of the most common and alarming warning signs you should be looking for when you're trying to make the shift from building great product to building a great company?

Sam: What are the most common mistakes to make when you're shifting to building a great company? I think I went through most of them here. I tried to put everything here that I see people mess up most of the time. Yes.

Audience member #7: Is there a way to get involved in the Yom community before getting accepted?

Sam: Is there a way to get involved with YC before getting funded? No and intestinally not. I say the one thing you can do is if you work at a YC company and then later apply - I think probably like - well not probably that definitely if you get a good recommendation from those founders will help with YC. So you know, working at a YC company helps but there's not much you can do to help. And that's intention. Like there is no pre start up in a way that there is premed. You should just focus on whatever doing and then when you start a start up - there are `things like YC and others that are structured to help you. Most of the founders we fund we don't know at all before we do it. You know you really don't need to get to knopw us or get involved. We're all good that way.

Audience member #8: The statistic you saying now harder to get into YCombinator than getting into Harvard. So I am curious the criteria’s that you use to pick up startups. Does it change over time?

Sam: The question is what criteria to pick startups and has it gotten harder? Has it changed? The two things that we need to see are good founders and a good idea. And without both of those we won't fund the company. But that hasn't changed. That is always been the case. The applicant pool to YC has grown quite a bit. But most of - a lot of the growth is people who shouldn't be starting start up anyone that are just do9ing it 'cause it is sort of the cool thing now. So you know if you're really passionate about an idea and the idea is good and you are smart and you get things done and your we executing - I still think you have a very reasonable shot at YC even though the headline number is bigger.

Audience member #9: There's a certain market that you’re really excited about that don’t necessarily know all about yet - is there a certain track you recommend or ways to?

Sam: Sure - if there's a market that you’re excited about but don’t a lot about yet what should you do? Two schools of thought on this. One is to just jump right in. Learn it as you go. That's worked a lot of times. The other is go work at another company in the space or do something in the market for a year or two years. I lean slightly towards the second but as long as you are willing to really learn and really study and to get uncomfortably close to your users - either case would work. And I don't even thinks that it’s that much of a disadvantage. I think all things being equal go spend a couple of years learning about it in detail but I don't think you have to.

Audience member #10: I have a question related to YC - So I think YC did a fantastic job in promoting partnership in Silicon Valley. In fact, I plan to invest in some in the next three years. You guys pump 180 companies per year coming to the market it looks like its hard to follow each of the YC company any more. Do you think that this will create some - some people will walk away from YC because they cannot follow large batch of companies and the company had to be very polished and the firm had to be think of the world about ideas?

Sam: Alright so I think the question is do I think investors are going to fund less YC companies as we grow. No. Definitely not. Like certainly the trend in this is the other way. We have more and more investors saying that half their portfolio is not YC companies and they look forward to the day where it's three quarters. No I don't think that’s a problem at all. I think that so not on my top hundred problem list. The opposite of that maybe.

Alright. One more question.

Audience member #11: When should a group of founders raise a seed round or Series A?

Sam: In general it's nice to wait until you have the idea figured out and initial signs of promise before you raise money. Razing money puts some pressure on the company. Sometime pressure. And once you've raised money you can't be in this exploratory phase in definitely. You end up having to rush and so like if you haven’t raised money and your idea is not working you can fall around and pivot until you really hit on the thing that’s working. But if you've raised money and your `idea doesn’t work - You're in this oh shit moment. And you have to pivot and you pivot to whatever vaguely plausible idea is. And that’s bad. So I think if you can wait to raise any outside capital more than say like a hundred or 200 thousand dollars even necessary - but ideally not even that. Until things are working or at least pointed in the direction of working you're way better off.

Alright thank you all very much! This was fun!
