Lecture 15: How to Manage 

When Sam originally sent an email for me to do this course, he said "Ben can you teach a fifty minute course on management?" And I immediately thought to myself, "Wow, I just wrote a three hundred page book on management. So that book was entirely too long."

當Sam給我發郵件
問我能否講50分鐘的管理課
我馬上想到
我剛寫了一本300頁的管理書
厚厚的一本書


I didn't actually have time to collapse the three hundred pages into fifty minutes. Like Mark Twain, I didn't have time to write a good short letter, so I'm going to write a long letter. But in this case, I am going to teach exactly one management concept.

短時間內沒法把300頁的內容
濃縮進50分鐘
就像Mark Twain一樣我沒法寫短信
那就只能寫長信了哦
所以本次課我只能講一章管理課內容


I see CEO's mess up this one management concept more consistently than anything else. From when they're very, very early to when they're very, very big as a company. It's the easiest thing to say and the most difficult to master. The concept in musical form is from Sly and the Family Stone. "Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong. My beliefs are in my song. No difference what group I'm in."

這一章的內容非常豐富
CEO們在這方面
最容易出岔子了
從他們剛起步
到公司做大一直都如此
這方面說起來最容易做起來最難了

That's the musical version of today's lesson. For those of you who are musical, you can leave now.

這些話摘自Sly And The Family Stone的歌詞
有時我是對的有時是錯的… 唱不下去了
這首歌形像地說明了我們今天的講座主題
學音樂的同學可以閃了

When you're making a critical decision, you have to understand how it's going to be interpreted from all points of view. Not just your point of view and not just the person you're talking to but the people who aren't in the room, everybody else. In other words, you have to be able, when making critical decisions, to see the decision through the eyes of the company as a whole. You have to add up every employee's view and then incorporate that into your own view. Otherwise your management decisions are going to have weird side effects and potentially dangerous consequences. It's a hard thing to do because at the point when you are making a decision, you're often under a great deal of pressure.

在管理中基本上是這樣的：
在你做重大決定時
你得全方面考慮
而不僅僅從個人角度考慮
不僅考慮到交談的對方
還要考慮到不在場的其他人
也就是說在做重大決定時
得從公司所有人的角度得從公司全局角度
看決定的利弊
也就是說得綜合公司所有人的角度
從而集合成你個人的角度
否則的話你的管理決定會帶來很多副作用
會產生很嚴重的後果
做到這點很難
因為在做決定時，你會頂著巨大的壓力

Let's get into the agenda. I am going to cover four cases. First, I am going to cover demotions, which are very emotional. Then raises, which are also emotional. Then we are going to evaluate one of Sam's blog posts, which is news to Sam. I figured I'd tease him since he invited me to do a fifty minute management class after I wrote a three hundred page book.

包含以下四個部分
首先要講的是降職
然後是升職這兩項都會影響員工情緒
然後我們分析一下Sams的一篇博文
Surprise！Sam
我寫了300頁的書他卻只讓我講50分鐘

Then I'm going to talk about history's greatest practitioner at this, I'm wearing a shirt with him on it, and how he used it to do something that nobody had ever done and has ever done since in human history. Basically complete mastery of the technique I am going to talk about.

我得報復一下他
然後我會講一下
史上最偉大的實踐者
我T恤上就印著這位偉人的頭像
講一下
他史無前例的做法
前無古人的做法
他將我今天所講的內容
運用得出神入化

So, first business example, you've got an executive, and do you demote or do you fire him? This comes from an actual conversation, an actual real life situation that I was working on with a CEO. The basic situation was this: he had a great executive he had hired. He was working harder than anybody else in the company and was doing everything he was supposed to. Everybody liked him because he worked so hard and was a generally a smart person, but he was in over his head knowledge-wise. He did not have the knowledge and the skills to do what the company needed him to do or really compete against the competition. So he couldn't actually keep him in the job, but he was a great guy. So the question is, should I fire this person or can I just move him into a lower role and bring in a person above him. That would be cool. Let's look at how you make that decision.

首先講個商業實例
假如有位主管（業績不好）給他降職還是開除他？
這是我和一位CEO
一起討論的一件真事
基本情況如下：
該CEO有個很棒的主管他工作努力
是該CEO招募的
該主管在公司裡是最努力的
他盡職盡責
大家都喜歡他
因為他工作努力又聰明
但是他只是聰明而已
他沒有足夠的知識和技能
使他勝任本職工作
例如他無法在競爭中取勝
使得他不能保住飯碗
不過呢他是個不錯的小伙子
那麼問題就來了是把他解僱
還是給他降職
讓別人來頂替他原先的職位？
怎麼把這事辦得漂亮呢？
我們來看一下如何做決定

You are, in this case, the CEO. It's really hard if somebody comes to work every day at six AM, is working until ten PM, and is working harder than anybody in the company. It's really hard to just say, "Well sorry, nice effort but you don't get an A for an effort. You get an F because I fired you."

這裡的“你”就是指CEO
如果
一個人每天早上6點就開始工作
一直工作到晚上10點
他比其他人都要努力
這樣的話很難對他說出口：
你工作很努力但是成績得不到A
只能得到F 得開除你

Nobody wants to have that conversation. A demotion is kind of neat because from a CEO's point of view, he can keep him in the company. He works so hard. He's a great example of somebody who gives great effort. He's got a lot of friends in the company, so from a cultural stand point it's a win/win because he gets to stay. Then I can bring in somebody who can solve my problem but I don't have to create another problem.

大家都不想這麼殘忍
這樣一來從CEO角度來看
給他降職就順理成章
可以使他繼續呆在公司
他工作努力
可以成為員工的榜樣
他在公司有很多朋友
從文化角度來看
這樣是雙贏
他能呆在公司
而且可以招到更合適的人頂替他
這樣問題解決了又沒有後顧之憂

If you think about it from the executive's perspective, it's like, "I don't want to be demoted but I really don't want to be fired because if I get fired, that’s a way harder more complicated thing to explain to my next employer that I got demoted. Getting demoted is, well I didn't really get demoted. I got a new job, a smaller title."

從主管的角度來看的話
他可能會這麼想：
我不想降職
但是我更不想被炒
因為被炒要比被降職
更難向下一位雇主解釋
降職的話可以這麼說
我其實沒有被降職啦只是得到了份新工作
職位低點而已啦

The last thing it enables, theoretically: the company values all of our employees. We brought you in. We made a commitment to you as an employee and it will enable you to keep growing with the company. This was the conversation I was having with the CEO and I said, “Well, wait a minute. Let me ask you this. What's the equity package that this executive has?" He goes, “Well, what do you mean?" I was like, “Well I would like to see direct level of compensation? Does he get a Vice President level of compensation? Does he have 1.5%? Does he have 0.4%?"

最後
理論上來說
降職可以體現出公司重視員工
公司把你招進來並向你承諾
公司重視員工的成長
可以使你與公司共同成長
因此
這就是我和那位CEO最初的對話
然後我說：等等
我問你一個問題
該主管有多少公司股權？
他幹得好的話會怎麼樣呢？
比如
他有主管級別的期權
還是副總裁級別的期權呢？
他有1.5%嗎？
他有0.4%嗎？是多少？

That gave the CEO pause. He's like, “Well, he does have 1.5% of the fully-diluted equity of the company." And I was like, “Ok. So you're an engineer in your company. How do you feel about somebody who used to be the head of sales who brought in with 1.5%? What do your engineers get? Do they get 0.1% of the company? 0.2%? What are they getting at this point? How are they going to feel about somebody who is NOT the Head of Sales with one point five percent of the company?" And he was like, " Uh oh." And I was like, “Yeah! Uh oh. Because how fair is that? Are you going to take the equity away? Are you up to do that? Are you up to go back and take back his compensation? How productive do you think he'll be if you take away his compensation? Secondly, will people give him the same respect now that you've demoted him? Because they knew him as this and now he's that. "I knew you when you were Head of Sales now you're the Regional Manager and you're telling me what the f*** to do? You're telling me I need to make that call? It seems to me you got demoted. Who are you to talk to me? I am the up and comer. I am going to be the next VP of Sales at the company."

此時CEO沉默了一會
說他有1.5%期權
我說：如果你是公司的工程師
公司前銷售主管
有1.5%的股權你會怎麼想呢？
工程師有多少股權呢？
差不多有0.1%​​ 0.2%
某位員工不再是銷售主管了
但還擁有1.5%的期權他們作何感想呢?
該CEO恍然大悟
這樣公平嗎？
你會拿回他的股權嗎
會拿回他的補償嗎？
如果取消他的補償
他的積極性會被打消嗎？
再想想
如果被降職了大家還會像以前一樣尊重他嗎？
大家都知道他原先是什麼職位現在是什麼職位
比如說我知道你以前是銷售主管
現在是區域經理
你還對我的工作指手畫腳？
你竟然讓我去打電話！
你都被降職了
你以為你是誰啊？
我是後起之秀
我很快就成了另一家公司的銷售主管了
這些事情會接踵而來

All these things come into play. When you look at the end, you may think you are dealing with one person. You may think that this is a demotion or a firing of one person. What does it mean according to that one person? But what you are really doing is saying, what does it mean to fail on the job? Particularly the highest paid, the highest compensated job in the company from an equity standpoint. And then, what's required to maintain your equity? Is it good enough to put in an effort or do you have to get a result? In different situations at different levels, the answers will be different. If this had been a person who was not an Executive brought in from the outside, but someone you promoted past where they should have been and didn't ever get that equity, maybe you make a different decision but you have to understand what it's going to mean to everybody, not just the person you're talking to.

所以縱觀來看
你以為你要處理的只是一個人而已
你以為只是降職或解僱一個人而已
僅僅影響當事人而已
其實你真正表現出的是
如果工作業績不達標會怎麼樣?
特別是
工資高期權多的工作
從期權角度來看
怎樣才能保住期權呢？
工作努力就夠了嗎？
還是得有績效？
在不同的情況下不同層次上
答案是不同的
如果該案例的當事人
不是那個別的地方招聘過來
的主管
而是從公司內部提拔的
並且沒有期權
或許你會做出不同的決定
你得想好你做出的決定對所有人的影響
而不僅僅是對當事人

Example two: An excellent employee asks for a raise. A good employee, this isn't like the last employee. First thing you think is they're really good, they asked me for a raise, they didn't ask me for no reason. They asked me because they think they deserve it. I want to retain them. I want to be fair! They've done a great job. I know that if I give them this raise, it's going to be all love coming my way. If I give you a raise we're good. You got a raise! It's awesome.

例2
一名優秀的員工
要求加薪
這跟前面例子中的員工不同
該員工工作優秀
一名優秀的員工要求加​​薪
想想看
第一反應是
該員工很優秀
員工不會無緣由地要求加薪
既然提出加薪必然他值得加薪
我想留住員工
我得公平
他工作出色
我想要公平
我明白如果給他加薪
對我是有好處的
如果給你加薪你好我好大家好
哥倆好
瞧瞧你
漲工資了
太棒了

From your perspective you know what you want to do when somebody asks you for a raise. What about from their perspective? How would they take it if you gave them the raise. You have to remember, for them to get to point where they ask you for a raise, they did not wake up one morning and say, "I am going in and asking him for a raise." This is something they've thought about a lot. They've compared their other options. They may have an offer from another company. It’s something their spouse probably has been talking to them about. It's a serious thing. If you give it to them, they're very likely to feel very good about it. They may be paranoid, like " Why you giving me a raise?" But very unlikely. Much more they'll feel like...

從你的角度來看
當有人要求加薪時你知道該怎麼辦
如果這麼來想
從員工角度考慮
如果你給他們加薪了他們會感想如何呢
你得記住一點
員工要求加​​薪
不會是一時衝動
不會一覺醒來想漲工資
這件事他們會深思熟慮
他們會再三比較
他們可能接到另一家公司的橄欖枝了
可能
已經和對象商量過了
這是件嚴肅的大事
如果答應給他們加薪
他們會很高興
也可能會疑惑
為什麼要給我加薪？
這種情況很少出現
更可能的情形是這樣的：


(Plays "The Shmoney Dance" video)

For those who don't know, that's Bobby Shmurda and Rowdy Rebel doing the Shmoney Dance. That's the reaction you'll get. So there is a lot of momentum to say, “Yes look. You know they've read Sheryl's book. They've leaned in and I'm going to reward them for doing all that."

有的同學可能沒看過這個視頻
Bobby Shmurda和Rowdy Rebel跳的是Shmoney Dance
得到加薪後最可能是這樣的表情
你很可能會答應給他們加薪
因為他們讀了Sheryll的書
受益匪淺
我得獎勵他們啊
發個廣告這本書很受用
我不是調戲Sheryll哈
大家別誤會

By the way, that book has very good advice. I'm not knocking Sheryl, I don't want you to misinterpret me. However, you knew there was going to be a however, you have to think about it from the point of view of the employee who did not ask for a raise. They may be doing a better job than the employee who did ask for the raise and in their mind they are going, “Ok, so I didn't ask for a raise and I didn't get a raise. They asked for a raise and they got a raise. What does that mean?" One, you're not really evaluating people's performance. You're just going, whoever asks, gets. That means I either need to be the guy who asked for the raise, though that's not how I feel. I do my work and I don't necessarily want to ask for a raise. Or I just need to quit and go to a company that actually evaluates performance. You can really make the person who doesn't get the raise feel pretty pissed about it Don't think that when someone is walking through your company doing the "Shmoney Dance," that other people aren't going to notice.

They are going to be fired up about that raise. You can say it is highly confidential that I am giving you this raise. It's not confidential.

大家別誤會
不過
你得從沒有要求加薪的員工角度
考慮一下
沒有要求加薪的員工
可能比提出要求的那名員工
工作得還要好
他們會這樣想
我沒有得到加薪因為我沒開口要
會哭的孩子才有奶喝啊！
這意味著什麼呢？
這意味著第一
公司沒有評估員工的工作表現
誰要求加薪誰就得到了
我要么會像那個人一樣
要求加薪
你懂得
這就是我的真實感受
我兢兢業業地工作卻沒有要求加薪太傻啦！
要么
我會辭職
去一家會​​評估員工業績的公司
你可能會讓
沒有得到加薪的員工惱火
不要奢望
有人在你們公司裡游行似地跳shmoney dance
其他人卻看不見

The cultural conclusion is that everybody in your company is going to feel that they now have a fiduciary responsibility to their family to ask for a raise all the time because if they don't, they may be missing out on a raise that they would have otherwise gotten. Talk to any experienced CEO and they will tell you this is true. If you give out raises when people just ask you for them, you will have a lot of people asking you for raises. That is called encouraging behavior.

員工會被加薪事件惹毛的
你可能會說
加薪的事天知地知你知我知
其實不然
這樣一來
公司的每位員工都會覺得
為了老婆孩子
得要求加薪
如果不提加薪要求
其他人都加薪了就落下自己了
和有經驗的CEO聊聊
他們會告訴你這是真事
有員工要求加​​薪你就同意了
這會造成很多員工要求加​​薪
這就稱為鼓勵行為

What do you do? The right answer is you have to be formal to save your own culture. I know this is always this is the thing that causes people running startups fits because it's like, " Well I don't want a lot of formalities. I don't want a lot of process. I want it to be organic. We want to do yoga. We want to only smoke organic weed." Sorry that was a Peter Thiel kind of way. Peter got very focused on who was smoking weed a little while ago.

該怎麼辦呢？
加薪這件事正確的處理方式是：正式處理
正式處理以此來保護公司文化
通常
這樣會使得很多創業公司很健康
很多公司不想有條條框框
不想有繁文縟節
希望公司有活力
“做瑜伽”
“抽有機菸葉”做這樣健康的事
哈哈說到Peter Thiel的糗事啦
他剛才一直問誰在抽煙呢

But the process actually protects the culture because what it does it says, look we're going to look at all inputs. We are going to have a formal way of saying anybody who wants a raise, come talk to me. I'm not going to give you a raise but I am happy to hear your story. I'm going to talk to all the people you work with so I get like a understanding. I am going to evaluate all the work that you've done, so I know where I actually rate and what my actual opinion is. I am going to do it periodically, I'm not going to do it daily. If I were fast moving I would do it every six months or even once a quarter. At the end of that process I will tell you what your raise is, I will tell you if you're getting one or if you're not getting one, but I'm not going to do things off cycle. I'm not going to do things when asked. There is one process and that's it.

有正式的加薪流程會保護公司文化
因為這樣的話
公司會看看所有的輸入
有正式的加薪流程就告訴大家
誰想加薪就過來找我
我不會馬上同意加薪
不過很樂意聽聽你的心聲
我會跟你的同事聊聊
以此來更好地了解你
我會評估你的工作
來看看你的業績怎麼樣
需要定期考核才能準確判斷
不會一朝一夕就完成的
如果時間充裕
我會每六個月或每三個月評估一次
評估結束後我會據此判斷是否加薪
告訴你是否能獲得加薪
我不會隨隨便便就做出判斷
我不會有求必應
得有套正式的流程

When I used to be CEO and I had executives, the bigger you become the harder this gets because the more aggressive the people working for you are. To be an executive it turns out you have to often be pretty aggressive. In most companies that's how you get to that level. I would go, “Look, you can lobby me all you want after the process is and I give you your raise, but you know what? I am not hearing it. I already went through my process. I got your input going in. I got everybody else's input. I've got so many people and so much money and you got what I believe is right."

Having a process gets people to be more comfortable because they don't have to always be on edge about, “Am I asking for what I deserve? Or am I getting aced out because of who I am, what I look like? I am not buddy buddy. I'm not at the golf course with you or I'm not doing whatever you like to do? I don't have to worry about any of that because I know your process. You're going to evaluate everybody and then you are going to give them what's fair." That's a much better way to handle that and it means that you're actually understanding what everybody thinks, not just the people you are talking to at the moment.

當我是CEO的時候
公司有幾名主管
職位越高加薪越難
因為主管一個個都野心勃勃的
要想做到主管
通常都得野心勃勃的
在大多數公司只有這樣才能做到這個級別
想加薪的話儘管跟我說\N306\N00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:0​​0,550\N但是只有經過一定的流程\N307\N00:15:0​​0,550 --> 00:15:0​​2,710\N我才會決定是否加薪你知道嗎？\N308\N00:15:0​​2,710 --> 00:15:0​​5,490\N這並不是空穴來風是經過了一定的流程\N309\N00:15:0​​5,490 --> 00:15:0​​7,200\N考慮了你的表現\N310\N00:15:0​​7,200 --> 00:15:10,000\N並且考慮了其他所有人的表現
考核了你做出的價值我才做出了判斷
有了像這樣的流程
會讓員工心裡更舒服
更舒服是因為不用再惦記著
要不要提出加自己應得的薪呢？
或者因為我個人魅力或相貌能不能得加薪呢？
我跟上司的關係不夠鐵
我不會拍馬屁
我不用擔心這些問題因為加不加薪流程說了算
我知道有正規的流程來考核大家
我會得到我應得的那一份
這樣的處理方式更好
這樣的話會顧及所有人的感受
而不僅僅是當事人
下面講點有意思的事

Now we are going to get into some fun stuff. We are going to evaluate Sam's blog post. There are some very good things in it and there are some things I am going to discuss.

This is the excerpt. "Most employees have only have 90 days after they leave a job to exercise their options. Unfortunately this requires money to cover the strike price and the tax bill..." I'll explain this a little more later, but I want to read it first. “... for the year of exercise. This is often more cash than what the employee has." This is the key. The employee often has to choose between leaving the job and walking away from the vested options i.e. the money that she has because she can't afford to exercise or being locked into staying with the company for all the wrong reasons. So it's a particularly bad situation when an Employee gets terminated. And I'll get into that and that's a really key point. "This doesn't seems fair. The best solution I have I've heard is from Adam D'Angelo, “ a very, very smart guy "at Quora. The idea is to grant options that are exercisable for 10 years from the grant date, which should be nearly all the cases. There's some tricky issues to this." Blah, blah, blah. “But it's still far better than just losing the assets. I think that this is policy that all startups should adopt."

我們來說說Sam的博客
裡面有不少好東西
我來評論一二
ppt上內容摘自Sam的博客
大多數員工在離職後
有90天的時間可以行使期權
不幸地是
還得補償履約價和稅
我稍後會解釋
我先讀完
在行使當年……
通常這需要的比員工手裡的錢要多
這點很關鍵
所以員工得做出選擇
是離職並放棄期權
（因為員工沒錢行使期權）
還是不情願地
繼續呆在公司？
如果員工是被炒這種情況更糟
我一會會講這點很關鍵
這不公平
我在Quora看到了最佳解決方案
是非常聰明的Adam D'Angelo提出的
方案就是：
無論公司發生什麼變化
離職後期權10年內兌換有效
這個方案也有些弊端
……
但是比失去期權要好得多
建議所有的創業公司採用這種方案

Was Sam right? Is this a policy that all startups should adopt? Let me first explain again what the policy is. Currently, the way almost every stock option package in startup world is this: you get stock that vests over a period of time. When you leave you have, and it depends on the company, 90 days. If you do not buy your stock in that period, it's gone! It's not yours anymore. Which, depending on when you entered the company, could be a big problem. A lot of companies today that have a high valuation, like an Airbnb or an Uber, when they bring you in they go “Wow, if you look at your 409A price compared to the preferred price, the stock we're giving you right now, the options are already worth 10 million dollars." And you're like" Woooo! 10 million dollars. I'm rich."

What they don't necessarily tell you is in order for you to get that money, because the preferred is worth 10 million dollars, your options are probably going to cost you 2.5 million dollars when you leave. If you don't have that 2.5 million dollars in 90 days, it's gone! You just lost all your money. So Sam is like, wow! That's fucked up! And so he wrote a blog post and he said everybody should change it.

The first question that you have to ask yourself is, "This has kind of been around since the 80's, so why has a rule like this been around for 30 years?" It turned out, Sam, I don't know whether he figured this out or just intuited it, but he was right. Something actually had changed. Up until 2004, there used to be a law called APB Opinion Number 25. That law was the old way to account for stock options. It's also the law that all the guys went to jail on. I know a lot of people who caught a case on APB 25, so I'm glad it's gone. It's a very confusing law. A lot people did not understand it and they literally went to jail.

我們要考慮的問題是Sam說的對嗎？
所有的創業公司都適合採用這種方案嗎？
我先說一下目前通用的方案
目前矽谷各家公司
以及全球各個創業公司的股票期權
幾乎都是這樣處理的：
離職後股票期權只能在一定時間內兌現
具體時間多少得取決於公司
一般是90天
如果在90天內不購買股權
股權就不是你的了
根據進入公司時情況的不同
可能會造成很大的問題
現在很多公司的估值都很高
如果你進入一家估值很高的公司
比如Airbnb Uber等等
當你進入這些公司時
根據409A評估價格
公司給你的股份
價值千萬
千萬哇有錢啦
但是他們不會告訴你的是
要想得到這筆錢
因為優先股的股價是1000萬
你得花250萬購買
在離職時
如果90天內湊不出250萬這1000萬就沒了
這1000萬就沒了
Sam認為這太操蛋了
所以寫下了這篇博文
他鼓勵改變這種現狀
對於這種事情
首先要問的問題是
為什麼從80年代起這種方案就一直使用
已經有30年了
我不知道
Sam經過深思熟慮還是靈光一閃
不過他的想法是對的
期間有過變動
在2004年制定了
APB第25號意見書
規定瞭如何處理股票期權
這部法律同時把很多人送進了監獄
很多人沒弄清楚APB25
幸好這部法律被取消了
因為太混亂不清了
造成了很多人不解
因此犯法
When that was a law, if you gave somebody 10 years to exercise their options, you would never have been able to go public and you would never have been able to be acquired because you were taking an expense that was tied to your stock price. The more your stock went up, the more compensation expense you'd have to take. The worst thing is you wouldn't know what it was going to be. It was totally unpredictable, so you could never forecast earnings. Ever! Because your earnings would be a function of your stock price. The more your stock price went up, the more money you would lose. In those days, people did not look through stock option expenses. It just wasn't doable. That's why everybody's agreement was written at 90 days. That's why it's there. So absolutely it's the right thing to question it being there. Are you guys following? You get this? This is more complicated than the first two examples, but it's a very important one.

Your perspective on this, if you have employees, is you want to be fair. Nobody wants to say to a hire,"Hey you got all this stock in 4 years... SIKE!" Especially when you fire someone. "Hey you're fired! I feel real bad about it BUT guess what? You know, I am also going to take all your money too!"

當該法律執行時
如果給員工十年的時間行使期權
那麼公司無法上市
也無法被收購
因為支付給離職員工的費用
是和股票價格掛鉤的
所以股票價格越高
支付給他們的補償金就越多
最差的情況是
不知道他們何時兌現
完全是未知的
也就無法預測收入
因為收入是所有股票價格的函數嘛
股票價格越高支付給離職員工的補償金越高
在此期間公司的股票期權
是無法計算的
這是不可行的
這就是為什麼如今的協議上
寫的都是90天
質疑這種做法是對的
大家能跟上嗎？聽懂了嗎？
這個例子比前面的兩個都要復雜
但是非常重要
如果你是雇主有員工要離職的話
你也想​​公平對待
沒人會想四年內卡著別人的股票
特別是解僱員工時
你不會囂張的說：你被炒魷魚了抱歉啦
知道嗎？我還要把你的錢拿走


That's a problem. This is the thing that you have to keep in mind, you have to think about the people who are staying and you want to reward the people who are staying. The perspective of the Employee who leaves, and this is really critical because this is your reputation, is I worked a year, where's my years pay? Now you're telling me about this 90 day exercise? I know it was in the small print of my stock option agreement but my Hiring Manager never told me about that. They never told me I was going to need 2 million dollars to get my stock. Which I don't have. So if I was rich I'd get my stock? That's not fair. So now I am fired and then I'm screwed. Guess what? I am going to tell EVERYBODY how you screwed me over. That's a real reputation problem. That's something that you have to consider for policy.

這樣也太囂張了
這樣會有問題
不過你還得照顧到
繼續留在公司的員工的感受
得獎勵這些人
離職的員工什麼時間能兌換期權很關鍵
因為會影響公司名譽
比如我辛辛苦苦工作一年了
我這一年的報酬呢？
現在就給我90天的時間兌換期權
我知道
在合同里寫了這一條
但是招聘我的經理並沒有跟我提到過
沒人告訴我離職時需要200萬美金才能保住期權
我沒這麼多錢啊
有錢才能保住期權
這不公平
我現在反正又沒工作一窮二白
你猜我會怎麼做？
我會告訴所有人
你把我坑慘了
這會影響公司聲譽
在處理該事件時得考慮到公司聲譽


You also have to consider the employee who stays. One thing that they're going to ask themselves is, look they're leaving and every time anybody leaves it’s like, was that smart? Your Employees know each other better than they know you. In any company, I don't care what company you are. Often the person they're really working with is going to be the person they know more. If that person leaves they're going to go " Well, should I leave too? What did they get and how does that compare to my deal?"

同時得考慮到還在公司的員工們
他們會為自己考慮
每當有人離職
他們都會想這樣明智嗎？
怎麼說呢
員工之間的了解要比你多
任何公司都是如此
他們會更了解
與他們朝夕共事的人
當同事離職大家會想
我要不要也離職呢？
根據他們離職後得到的多少可以推算出我的

If we look at the situation and analyze it, there are a lot of components. First, companies tread a lot of people around here, the average is somewhere around 10 percent. It's probably getting higher, particularly if you are in San Francisco just because of the culture there. Silicon Valley companies dilute like 6-8 or even 10 percent a year for employee options. You have to keep in mind that as mean as it is, if that employee leaves and can't exercise their options, those options come back to the pool where you can potentially give them to people who are already there. You're actually taking less dilution. That's something that you have to think about. I am not saying you have to act on it but it's something that you have to think about it.

如果我們分析一下的話
要考慮很多因素
每年有很多人離職
平均離職率是10%
有可能更高
特別是舊金山的公司
舊金山有這樣的文化
矽谷的公司每年給員工分股
會稀釋股份6~8% 甚至達到10%
你得時刻記著
這就意味著如果員工離職並且不能行使股權
這些股權又回到公司
這些股權又可以分給公司目前的員工
這就使得股權稀釋得少了
這點你得考慮到
並不是鼓勵大家拿回股權
只是提示大家注意這點

Secondly, losing all your stock is a very big incentive to stay. That could be good news or bad news. It could be good news in that you get to keep somebody you might have lost. It could be bad news in that you kept them for the exact wrong reason: they have handcuffs on. You may get an Employee that is worse than not having an Employee. On the other hand, a 10 year option on a highly volatile security, for those of you who have taken that class, is valuable. 10 years option, volatility and length, that's the value of an option.

第二點
害怕失去期權會促使員工留下來
這樣有利有弊
利處是
這樣會留住員工
弊處是
員工是為了股權不情願地留下
因為這樣的束縛使他們沒法走
這樣的話
有這個員工還不如沒有呢
另一方面
員工10年內行使期權會給公司帶來不穩定因素
對於上過那個課的同學來講…
有人上過那個課嗎？那個課很有用

10 years on a Startup stock, that's a valuable thing. Remember the employee who stays doesn't get that. The employee who stays just gets a stock. They don't get the new job and the new stock. They get one thing but they don't get both things. You have to weigh that in. This is a hard one. It should be reevaluated by every company. I wouldn't go as far as Sam and say it should be adopted by every company. You have to think about what you want. I would offer two Alternative Cultural Statements. One is, we treat employees with straight forwardness. We're going to be fair and therefore you get 10 years to exercise your stock. What we said we're going to give you, you’re going to get regardless of how rich or poor you are. That's just a done deal.

十年期權會帶來
不穩定因素
對於創業公司而言10年後股票會漲很多
記住留在公司的員工是分不到這份股權的
留在公司的員工只能得到原有的期權
他們沒法再找新工作沒法再得到其他公司的期權
不能像離職的員工那樣魚和熊掌兼得
你得把這點考慮進去
這個問題比較難辦
每個公司都得根據自己的情況評估一下
我不會建議每個公司都採取同樣的方案
大家根據自己的情況考慮一下對策
我給大家提供兩種方案
第一是對員工開誠佈公
公司對待員工公平
因此會給你十年時間兌現期權
無論你是貧窮還是富有
公司承諾給你的都會給你
一言為定

The second way to handle it - no companies do this, which is why I actually really like this post that he wrote - is you can say up front, " Look you are guaranteed to get your salary but for your stock to be meaningful, these are the things that have to happened. You have to have vested. Two, you have to stay until we get to an exit. Untile the company makes it. You've got other money." Finally, the company actually has to be worth something. Because 10 percent of nothing is nothing. The reason we set the policy this way is we really value people who stay. So don't join this company if you are going to join another one in 18 months because you're going to get screwed. Our policy guarantees you're going to get screwed.

Those are two ways to handle it. It really depends on you and how you want to run your culture. With all these things, it's critical to think it through from everybody's prospective because when push comes to shove, that's going to matter. That's going to change the outcome of your company.

還有一種方案不過還沒有公司這麼辦
我在ppt上寫出來了
跟員工說明白工資一分沒少地都給你了
要想兌現期權
有幾種辦法
第一自籌資金
第二你得繼續留在公司
等公司成功了
或是你有足夠的錢買回期權
等到
公司上市了
因為只有公司值錢公司的10%才值錢
我們之所以製定這樣的政策
因為我們要保護堅守在公司的員工的利益
如果你打算一年半後就跳槽到另一家公司
就別加入我們公司了
因為你來我們公司撈不到什麼好處
我們公司的政策決定了離職的下場
這是兩種方案
具體怎麼操作還得取決於你們自己公司的文化


Sam: I am actually revising my recommendation slightly.

Ben Horowitz: Let’s hear it.

Sam: No, it's that I think there needs to be more incentive to stay. If someone gets fired, I still think they get screwed a lot of the time.

Ben Horowitz: The other thing that's really important, that Sam pointed out, is how much money you have. If you have the money, you don't get screwed. You can buy your stock. You do take some risks, but you can buy your stock. If you don't have the money, you don't have the money.

還有一點
很重要
Sam指出來了
是不是境遇慘取決於你有沒有錢
如果有錢的話境遇就不會慘
把期權買下就可以脫身而出
雖然得冒點險但是還是可以買下期權的
如果沒有錢的話期權就沒了
就講到這

Now we're getting to the person on my shirt: Toussaint. He was the best at this and I want to take you through some examples because they're very powerful. Toussaint was born a slave. He wasn't just born a slave, he was born a slave in the most brutal place to be a slave, which was the Colony of Santa Domingo, now known as Haiti. This was a much more severe form of slavery, as were all the sugar growing areas, then in the US, which was historically a very brutal form of slavery. To give you some numbers, over the course of slavery, somewhere like 400 years, a million slaves were brought to the US. At the end of slavery, there were four million slaves in the US. In that same period, in the sugar growing countries in the Caribbean, two million slaves were brought over and at the end of slavery there were seven hundred thousand left. From just a quantitative perspective, nearly 10 times more brutal. I am going to read this to you. I don't know if I quite have time but I don't care. I'll read you a description of slavery in Toussaint's area.

下面講一下我T恤上的這個人Toussaint
他精通於全面考慮問題
我給大家講幾個
他的經典例子
提到Toussaint 不得不說他的出身
這對理解他很有用
他生下來就是奴隸
他不僅僅生下來就是奴隸
他還出身在對待奴隸最為殘酷的
Santo Domingo殖民地
現在稱為海地
該地區的奴隸制度比
美國甘蔗種植園地區還要嚴酷
歷史上美國甘蔗種植園地區奴隸制度就很嚴酷了
給大家說幾個數字來感受下
在400年左右的奴隸制時期
有100萬奴隸被帶到美國
在奴隸制廢除時美國有400萬奴隸
同時期有200萬奴隸被帶到
加勒比海的甘蔗種植國家
在奴隸制廢除時只剩下70萬奴隸
從這些數字來看
加勒比海地區奴隸制要10倍的殘酷
我給大家讀一下
不知道時間來不來得及不管了
讓大家有個大體印象
奴隸制的殘酷不僅僅是數字的問題
我給大家讀一下Toussaint所在地區的嚴酷

Whipping was interrupted in order to pass a piece of hot wood on the buttocks of the victim. Salt, pepper, citrus, cinders, aloes and hot ashes were poured into bleeding wounds. It's not to heal them. This is to make it worse. Mutilations were common. Limbs, ears and sometimes private parts to deprive them of the pleasures which they could indulge without expense. Their masters poured burning wax on their arms and hands and shoulders. Emptied the boiling king sugar over their heads. Burning them alive. Roasting them on the slow fires. Filled them with gun powder and blew them up with a match. Buried them up to their neck and smeared their head with sugar that that the flies might devour them. Fastened them to the nest of ants or wasps. And made them eat the excrement, drink the urine, lick the saliva of other slaves. One Colonist was known `in moments of anger to throw himself on a slaves and stick his teeth into their flesh.'
That's the slavery that he grew up in. It's really important to understand this because to get out of that perspective was not easy. But he had a vision that was threefold. One, he wanted to end slavery. Two, he wanted to actually take control of the country and run the country. And three, he wanted it to be a world-class country. Not one in which he had simply freed the slaves but one that could compete on a worldwide basis. That was his mindset going in. What I read was the environment he came from.

A management example is conquering the enemy. The sequence of battles that occurred in Haiti were, he first had to defeat the locals. Once he defeated the locals, there were several countries that were very, very interested in taking control of Haiti. Principally Spain, England and France. He had to defeat those armies as well. When he conquered them, he had to decide what to do with the conquered soldiers and the leaders on the other side. He took into perspective three different points of view. One, his soldier’s point of view. Two, his enemies point of view. And finally ,the point of view of the resulting culture. What kind of country was he building? The army was going to be the seed corn for the culture of the whole country.

鞭打夠了然後把一塊熱木炭
烙在奴隸的屁股上
鹽胡椒粉香櫞煤渣蘆薈油和煙灰
倒在血淋淋的傷口上
這些粉末不會治療傷口只會加重傷勢
被殺已經是家常便飯
奴隸的四肢耳朵有時甚至私處會被剁下
剝奪了他們作為人的快樂
奴隸主為所欲為
將滾燙的熱水倒在
奴隸的胳膊手肩膀上
把滾燙的蔗糖倒在奴隸身上把他們活活燙死
用慢火把他們烤死
把他們體內填入火藥並點燃
把他們活埋把露出來的頭上倒上糖
蒼蠅會爬滿他們頭上
把他們綁在螞蟻窩或蜂窩旁
讓他們吃屎喝尿
舔其他奴隸的口水
一個殖民者臭名昭著
他生氣的時候會咬奴隸的肉
以上就是Toussaint的成長環境
知曉當時的情況對理解他很重要
因為要壓制這樣的仇恨並非易事
但是他有三個遠大抱負
第一結束奴隸制度
第二
接管國家
第三使自己的國家躋身一流國家
不僅僅是結束奴隸制度
而要使國家躋身世界一流行列
他有這樣的抱負
而他的出身又是那樣的困苦
第一個管理學例子是征服敵人
經歷了一系列戰事順序是這樣的：
首先打敗當地敵人
打敗了當地敵人之後
還得對付一些大國
像西班牙英國法國
這些大國一直對海地虎視眈眈
得打敗這些大國
打敗對方後
他得決定如何處理戰俘
以及敵方將領
他從三個角度
進行考慮
第一戰士角度第二敵人角度
第三導致的國家文化
比如要建立什麼樣的國家？
因為軍隊會
成為國家文化的基礎
From the soldier’s perspective: do we get to pillage? Soldiers like to pillage. It’s something for their work. The second thing is they're trying to kill us so we should kill them. That's a basic perspective of the people who are fighting for him, the most important people to Toussaint. I put pillage up there, a couple of things to know, one I didn't put rape up there. Very interestingly, not only did he not allow rape among his army, but he didn't even allow his officers to cheat on their wives. If they did he would get rid of them because he was so concerned about the resulting culture. What was it going to be? Was it going to be productive? Was it going to be the best in world? Or was it going to be something less than that? That was his mindset going in. His army was actually famous for not pillaging. They were already actually used to this. This was one of the most surprising things to the conquered people to the point where where even the white people were very impressed because he would go into their city and not pillage even though he would win. Again, this is because he took a long view of the culture.

從士兵角度考慮
軍隊要打劫嗎？
士兵喜歡打劫
可以掠奪財物犒勞自己
還有一點敵人想殺死我們
我們就應該殺死他們
這是為國家浴血奮戰的
戰士的想法
他們是國家的恩人
注意幾點我提到了掠奪
但是沒有提到強姦
有趣的是
他不僅不允許戰士強姦
甚至不允許他們對妻子不忠
如有違反就會被開除
因為他對於文化非常謹慎
會形成什麼樣的文化？該文化是否會促進生產力？
是世界上最好的文化嗎？
還是成不了最好的？
這是他要考慮的
他的軍隊以不掠奪著名
他們軍隊習慣於此
以不掠奪著名
這點讓戰俘最驚訝了
他在海地享有盛譽
甚至白人都欽佩他
因為他即使勝利攻下城市
也不會掠奪
因為他在文化方面高瞻遠矚


This is an important subtle point. He believed the culture of Haiti, because it was a slave culture, sugar plantation culture, was pretty low grade compared to what he had experienced in Europe when he dealt with the Europeans. He thought that slave culture was even more broken than Haitian culture because it's the kind of culture where, "Oh you don't do what I tell you? I'm going to beat you to death. I am going to blow you up with gun powder." If you think about the behavior that ensues from that, that was the culture he knew he needed to replace. He knew he needed to upgrade.

這是個很重要的立足點

促使他形成了自己的一套方案
因為海地是種植園文化
是奴隸製文化
因此是低等文化
比不上他在歐洲與歐洲人交往時
感受到的文化
他認為奴隸製文化比海地文化
還要腐朽不堪
因為奴隸製文化
就是這樣的文化：
如果你不按我說的辦我就把你打死
我會把你肚裡填滿火藥把你炸爛
這樣的暴力行為
是由奴隸製文化衍生而來
他知道得改變這種文化
得提昇文化

His solution when he conquered the British, or the Spanish, or he conquered the French, was he would take the very best people from the opposing side and he would make them generals in his army. You probably didn't expect that. Here are the guys trying to kill him. He's leading a slave evolution and when he conquers the enemy, he actually incorporates them into his army and makes them part of it. He wanted the expertise and he wanted the culture to be at a much higher level.

他的解決方案是當戰勝英國
戰勝西班牙戰勝法國時
他會俘獲最優秀的人才
使他們做自己軍隊的將軍
這點可能出乎大家意料
這些人明明是想殺死他的人
他領導的是奴隸革命
當他打敗敵人時
他卻將他們
引入自己的軍隊
因為他需要專業人才
他想使自己的文化更上一層樓
The second question he had, this even more complicated, was what do you do with the slave owners? You're leading slave revolution, you take control of the country,what do you do with the slave owners? Three perspectives again. For the slaves, you want to kill the slave owners. There is no question. That's your land now. You won. F them. From Toussaint's perspective, it was more complicated because he wanted Haiti to be a first world country and sugar was really important. The whole slave economy was the sugar economy. On the other hand, he was a slave and he had to have been pretty upset. Particularly given the type of slavery. But he didn't know how to run a sugar plantation and he didn't have any business relationships for trading sugar. So what to do? If you look at the slave owner perspective, it's pretty interesting because they're coming at it - and this is the point of view that he actually had the discipline to understand - they were coming from a cost structure that was predicated on slave labor. Their business didn't work without slave labor. If they had to pay people their cash flow wouldn't work. They paid a lot of money for the slaves up front and they paid a lot of money for the land. In their mind, that was how business worked. You can't just change the economics and have it still work. They knew they had some power because of the position they were in.

So what was the answer for the slave owners? The solution was one, to end slavery. Two, let the slave owner keep their land. Three, make them pay their workers. There was no more slave labor. In order to fund that, lower their taxes. You guys ought to be kind of impressed with that.

Lower the taxes of the slave owners after you defeat the slave owners and end slavery. But the bigger goal was he wanted a stronger culture. The way he treated those slave owners, the need to keep the economy going was important. Let's look at the results. First of all, Toussaint's revolution is the only successful slave revolution in the history of mankind. There has never been another one and, hopefully we won't have slavery in a big way, there won't be another one. He's it. Two, the plantation owners kept their land. Three he defeated Napoleon. He had a booming economy and a world class culture. Under Toussaint, Haiti had more export revenue than the United States. That's how successful he was in the revolution. This is the power of looking at a situation not just from your point of view, but from the point of view of all the constituents. Even the people you hate. Which is hard to do when you are a CEO and harder to do when you are leading the revolution.

In conclusion, the most important thing that you can learn, and one of the hardest things to do, is you have to discipline yourself to see your company through the eyes of the employees, through the eyes of your partners, through the eyes of the people you are not talking to and who are not in the room.

Thank you.

他要面對的第二個問題更複雜
如何處置奴隸主？
領導奴隸革命並且勝利
如何處置奴隸主？還是從三個角度考慮
如果你是奴隸
並且打敗了奴隸主
你當然想殺死他們
這點毫無疑問
你不僅想殺死他們現在國家是你的地盤了
得聽你的
從Toussaint角度考慮事情就更複雜了
因為他想把海地創建成一流國家
蔗糖對國家非常重要
整個奴隸制經濟可以說是蔗糖經濟
另一方面他本身是奴隸
他對奴隸制
恨之入骨
但是他還想到
他根本不懂如何經營蔗糖種植業
而且沒有和蔗糖經銷商
建立合作關係
這與戰爭不同
戰爭的話勝者為王
這是基本準則
該怎麼辦呢？
從奴隸主角度來看的話
挺有意思的
他能明白
奴隸主的價值
奴隸制經濟是基於\N726\N00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37​​,560\N廉價的奴隸勞動力的\N727\N00:34:38​​,720 --> 00:34:41,810\N沒有奴隸經濟就運作不起來
如果要支付報酬的話
現金流就會斷
奴隸主花了大價錢購買奴隸
花了大價錢購買土地
在他們的意識裡
生意就是這麼做的
沒法背離基本經濟定律
還期望經濟仍然繁榮發展
所以奴隸主靠自己的地位來壓榨奴隸
所以怎麼處置奴隸主呢？
他提出了一種方案第一步結束奴隸制
第二步讓奴隸主繼續保留土地
第三步強制奴隸主支付報酬
沒有了免費奴隸得支付給工人工資
降低稅收來支持該項政策
大家會大吃一驚吧
打敗了奴隸主結束了奴隸制之後
竟然給原先的奴隸主減稅！
不過他目標遠大他希望擁有更強的文化
維持經濟的發展非常重要
還得善待奴隸主
我們一起看一下Toussaint政策的結果如何
首先
Toussaint革命是
人類歷史上唯一成功的奴隸革命
希望將來也不會有了
將來不會再有奴隸制了
不會再有像Toussaint所處的那樣的奴隸制了
第二點種植園主保留土地
第三點打敗了拿破崙
海地經濟快速發展擁有了一流的世界文化
在Toussaint帶領下
海地出口收入比美國要高
他領導的革命如此的成功
這就是綜合考慮的強大之處
不僅僅從自己的視角考慮
要從大局考慮
甚至包括你仇恨的人
作為CEO 做到這個境界很難
領導革命做到如此難上加難
總而言之
作為CEO 從Toussaint事蹟中學到的最重要
同時也是最難的是
要“逼”著自己
透過各種相關人的眼睛看待問題
透過員工的眼睛透過合夥人的眼睛
透過其他相關利益人的眼睛即使你和他們並不共處一室
也從無交流謝謝大家

Now I will take questions.

下面到問答環節了

Q: If you have to fire or demote an executive, how do you have the conversation and then how do you explain it to everyone else?

問題是如果要開除現任主管
第一如何跟他們說呢？
第二如何向其他人解釋

Ben Horowitz: Right, this is great question. Clearly it's some kind of failure. You failed on hiring. You failed on integrating. They failed at their job. The first thing when firing the person is to really try to be honest. You're feeling like you failed. Common reactions are, you suck and so I am firing you. Screw off. That's not good because it's not really true. You may be feeling that way. Another common mistake is to be too mushy. It's not you it's me. This feels like a weird break up with an ex-boyfriend that you really didn't like.

Generally when you hire people, you try to hire the very best. You hire people who are qualified to do the job. The reason they fail on the job is you made some mistake in the hiring process and you didn't match them to the needs of your company accurately enough. That's the number one reason why this fails and so that's generally a good place to start. To say look, here's how we are and here's what I didn't recognize about us and about you when I made the decision. It is what it is. We're going to have to move on.

When you talk to the Employees about it, it's different. You can take somebody's job, you have to take their job, but you don't to take their dignity. This is something Bill Campbell taught me. It's not necessary to get up in front of the company and say, "I blew that mother fucker out. I capped his ass."

In fact it's not good. Nobody feels good about that.You might feel proud of yourself but nobody else feels good about that. The right thing to do is thank them for their work. Like let people know that they're moving on. You don't have to explain all their personal details. It's more important to leave them with their dignity and let them go on to live another day. What you say at that meeting is their reputation, because everybody in your company is going to call on that person when they try and get their next job. If you start saying a bunch of BS about them, that's not going to be good and it's not going get interpreted as we screwed up, it's going get interpreted as he screwed up. You have to be very honest with them but you have to make sure you preserve their dignity when you talk to the company.

因為顯然這也是你的失誤
招人時沒把好關沒有使新員工融入好
他們工作沒做好
總之是失敗
在解僱員工的時候首先要做到的一點是
要坦誠相待
你可能這麼想員工工作沒做好
通常的反應是
會有多個反應
比如你太差勁了捲鋪蓋走人吧
這樣做不好因為事實可能並非如此
這樣做不好
另一種常見的錯誤時
太含糊
“你沒有錯都是我的問題啦”
就像和不太中意的前男友分手那樣
說些客氣話
在招人的時候
會盡力招到最好的
會僱稱職的人
如果招到的人做不好
一般的原因就是招人的時候出現偏差
沒有足夠準確地找到
符合公司要求的人
這是首要原因
所以可以這麼跟他們說
“事到如今不得不說
我做招人決定的時候
沒有充分認清公司的發展和你的情況
造成了現在的情況
是時候大家放手向前看了”
在和員工約談時
怎麼跟他們說造成的結果差別很大
你可以解僱某人
Bill Campbell教給我一點
你必須得拿走他的工作
但是不必拿走他的尊嚴
不必當其他員工的面
對他說
“滾吧”
這麼做不好
因為會傷感情
你可能覺得這樣做挺爽挺驕傲的
其他人不會這樣覺得
正確的做法是感謝他們對公司做出的貢獻
放手讓他們另謀高就
不必抱怨他們的缺點
讓他們有尊嚴地離開更重要
讓他們有活下去的勇氣
你在那次會上說什麼了？
聲譽
因為公司其他人想跳槽時
會給離職員工打電話諮詢
如果在他們離職時你口出惡言
這樣會後患無窮
他們一交流就會變成
不是員工搞砸了
而是你搞砸了
要做到兩點
要對他們誠實
但是又得給他們留自尊

Q: I was reading your book yesterday. How did you deal with all the stress? Was it meditating? Hip Hop?

我昨天讀了您的書
開始覺得心神不寧
對不住了
真的是這樣
我有個問題
想必其他同學也會有這個疑問
你有什麼緩解壓力的妙招嗎？

Ben Horowitz: The answer is I used to be 6 foot 4 and good looking so clearly not very well. I get asked that a lot and I have a great answer for it. I have a wonderful wife who is sitting right here. I will oar and he borrowed that technique from him but applied it in a much kind of more dramatic context. He had British, French, Spanish, slaves and mulattoes, most of the mulattoes in Haiti at that time were pro-slavery. That was another issue, but his leadership was so great, everybody wanted to join him.

問題是
作為CEO 我如何緩解壓力
我身高1.84米體型健美
這些方法不適合我
經常有人問我這個問題
對於這個問題我沒有什麼好辦法
我覺得
我有一位很棒的妻子
就坐在旁邊
如果你能娶/嫁給
一位支持你的對象
壓力就會小非常多
如果不是妻子的支持我估計早就死翹翹了
緩解壓力要注意一點
把注意力集中在你能做什麼上
而不是發生的破事上
這件事很難辦
因為大家不斷地問你
我們該怎麼辦啊？
錢快花完了死定了
你不能老盯著這些事
你要關注的是我有哪些選擇？
我能做什麼？我們何去何從？
要尋求
成功的機會

Q: How do you incorporate Toussaint's ideology and get people who were previously against you on your side?
Toussaint如何
將法國將軍收入麾下的呢？

Ben Horowitz:What he did in general is the right thing. You have to show them a better way, as a leader, if somebody's your enemy and you need to convert them. This happens in business too. Somebody is a competitor and you want to bring them over but you don't want to bring in, ethically, people who switch from one competitor to another. Your culture has to be elevated, your mission has to be elevated. Your way of doing things has to be just better. That was what was so compelling for the rest of the army.

Toussaint如何將法國將軍收入麾下的呢？
關鍵是
他們很驚異他竟然沒殺他們
他們的想法是：
我們打的是奴隸軍
失敗後他們一定會殺死我們
他卻沒有殺死他們
讓他們三觀為之一震
顛覆了他們三觀
他們對他的忠誠度\N891\N00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,​​060\N甚至高於對法國的忠誠度\N892\N00:42:26,​​060 --> 00:42:28,520\N他從Julius Caesar那
借鑒了一些技巧
他天資聰穎
以至於奴隸主都意識到了把他安排到圖書館
奴隸主想扶持Toussainte來管理種植業
在圖書館裡
他學到的最多的是Julius Caesar
他從Julius Caesar身上借鑒了該技巧
並應用到了更加複雜的情景下
他的軍隊裡有英國法國西班牙奴隸
當時海地的大部分黑白混血兒
也是奴隸
這是另一點原因
主要還是他的領導能力出色大家想加入他的隊伍
請講
你如何運用Toussainte的思想“同化”
與自己敵對的人呢？
這個問題嘛
因人而異
他的策略是…
忘了說一下問題了
你如何運用Toussainte的思想“同化”
與自己敵對的人呢？
一般而言
正確的做法是
向他們證明你的做法更好
作為領導人
得同化敵人
商業中也是如此
得把競爭對手
拉過來
可以把競爭對手拉過來
但是不能把道德有問題的人拉過來
他們會挑撥離間
你的文化得更先進
使命更崇高
做法更好
這樣的話才能吸引對方

Q: I am curious to learn how you have built a culture around people and among the entrepreneurs that you work with that has differentiated you in the market from all the other venture capital firms.

你有沒有創建獨特的文化
使得你們公司在風投（VC）中
與眾不同呢？

Ben Horowitz: Probably not the best question for me. I can ask Sam that. I don't know. The question is how we do build a culture out at Andreessen Horowitz that is differentiated us from all other VC's. I feel like that is certainly the goal. We have been around for 5 years now. The attempt that we made, it's for the rest of the world to judge if we succeeded, was this: in the old days of VCs, when I was a entrepreneur, the basic idea was you have an entrepreneur or inventor and they get a company to a point and at that point they either are ready to be CEO or you would go find a CEO to replace them and build "the company." Our cultural philosophy is that the founder and inventor are special. We're going to design the firm and the culture of the firm to help the founder develop into a CEO. We do a lot of systematic things different. The two biggest are all of our partners are founders or CEOs. It's an original model where some sort of experience is required. That's a joke.

If you are an advisor to a CEO you have to have have been a CEO. Imagine that. That's why I like Sam, he used to be a CEO. He doesn't talk about it that much but he was a CEO and was good at it. The second part is that a professional CEO will bring in, in the old days, a network of people that knows. Guys who brought technology in big corporations to important partners in the field to people in the press. We try to build that network on your behalf at the firm. I think we do a better job of that than anybody else. Those are the ways that we try to be different.

這個問題我可能回答不好
Sam更專業一些
問題是
我們有沒有打造Andreessen Horowitz的文化
使得我們在VC中與眾不同？
這當然是我們的目標
我們公司創立大約5年了
我們嘗試著這麼做
世人自行評價吧
我們差不多是這樣的：
以前的VC 當我還是創業者時
基本上是這樣的：有創業者需要融資
他得把公司做到一定規模
做到這個規模後他勝任的話就當CEO
否則你就選個人做CEO
組建“公司”
我們的文化哲學觀是這樣的：
創始人要特別
我們要打造公司文化
幫助創始人成長為一個CEO
我們要係統地做很多事情
最重要的兩個是
我們公司的合夥人都是創始人CEO
如果有人…
我們最初的座右銘是：得有經驗！開玩笑啦
你如果要指導CEO
得自己做過CEO才能勝任
這就是為什麼Sam就當過CEO
他不怎麼提起這段經歷
他的確當過而且做得很好
然後第二點是
專業的CEO會
招賢納士
會吸引人才加入公司
比如同領域的重量級的合夥人
在Google Facebook有過工作經驗的人才
相識的媒體人
等等
在公司內打造這樣的
資源網
在這方面我們做得更好一些
我們力爭與眾不同

Q: Putting yourself in other people's shoes is very important. Can you give us some tips?
在管理中
能設身處地為他人著想很難
能給我們一些這方面的建議嗎？

Ben Horowitz: Putting yourself in other people’s shoes is difficult in management. It's hard in daily life. It's even harder in management because it's the stress at the moment. If a great employee is asking you for a raise, it is very hard for not to respond because you do not want to lose them and they are not asking you for a raise randomly, they are asking you for a reason. If you don't have a process in place to go stop back out, you have to pause yourself. If somebody comes to you with something that you know is important, you want to feel like you have all the answers. Right now you guys are asking me questions and if I don't know the answer I will make something up because I want you guys to think I am smart.

The most importan thing is to pause. If you know something is really important and you haven't thought it through, just to say, "I am taking this really seriously but I have to pause because I have to think it through from all perspectives. I’m going to come back." I end up doing that a lot just because there are a lot of things that you run into that you have never seen before. Most CEO's, including myself, learn this the hard way. You go ok, I'm going sneak away with this. Nobody's going to see me give them the raise. I'm going to do it and it’s going to be all under the covers. Confidentiality baby. Then it blows up in your face three weeks later and you're like, "Oh my God. What have I done?" Or three months later or even a year later. Then once it's a year later, it's a huge problem.

You've taken what was a little emotional problem and you've turned it into a forest fire. We call it a Kimchi problem. The deeper you bury it the hotter it gets. It's a Korean joke. It takes practice. It’s very difficult to do. My friend Bill Campbell, this is his big skill. People always trying to describe him to me and I’m like that is not him at all. That’s not what he’s good at. He’s good at seeing the company through the eyes of the employees. If you are good at that, you will very likely be an elite leader.


你是怎麼做的？
能設身處地為他人著想
的確很難
你覺得該怎麼做呢？
在生活中就很難在管理中則難上加難
因為要面臨壓力
比如說優秀的員工提出要漲工資
很難做出回應
因為你不想失去他
他提出漲工資絕不是心血來潮
是有原因的
你呢
你沒什麼
退路
作為領導人
關鍵的一點是得停下來想想
如果有人找上門來
你知道該事情挺重要
作為領導人
你想要無所不知
就像現在你們問我問題
即使我不知道答案也得編一下
因為我想讓大家覺得我很聰明嘛
遇到重要的事情
得停下來想想
如果某事很重要
你還沒有想過這個問題
你得誠實地說：你說的事挺重要
這個事我還沒有想過我得好好想想
我想好後再給你答复
我經常這麼做
因為工作中會出現
很多新問題
直接點告訴大家吧大部分CEO
包括我在內都在這方面摸爬滾打
你偷偷做三四次
悄悄地處理這件事
沒有人看到我給他漲工資了
我這麼悄悄地做
沒人知道
三週
三個月甚至一年後
想像破滅了後悔不已
瞧瞧我都乾了什麼事啊！
這麼乾一年後事情就鬧大了
你已經將星星之火
變成了燎原之勢
我們一般稱之為泡菜問題
埋得越深變得越熱
韓國笑話~~
得多學多練
是挺難做的
我的朋友Bill Campbell
在這方面很擅長
很多人像這樣描述他：
他不擅長那個
他不擅長那個但是他擅長這個
他擅長從員工的視角看待公司
如果這方面能做好
你會很有潛力成為一個優秀的領導
謝謝大家


Thank you.
