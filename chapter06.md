# Lecture 6: Growth 

http://genius.com/Alex-schultz-lecture-6-growth-annotated

This is awesome; I’ve been watching the lectures on this course, and isn’t it absolutely amazing, the content? And now, you’re stuck with me. We’ll see how that goes.

謝謝您能來
，謝謝
，這門課太棒了
。前面幾節課我一直關注著
，講的真是太棒了！
今天只能委屈大家聽我講了。

Unlike Paul when he was talking in the Q&A and you guys asked him what he’d do if he was in college today and he said physics, I actually indulged myself. I went and did physics at Cambridge. I think physics is an amazing class to give you transferable skills that are really useful in other areas, but that’s not why you’re listening to me today; physics isn’t the class.
我們正式開始
，在Paul演講的問答環節中
，同學們問他如果他現在上大學的話他會學什麼專業？
，他回答說是物理
。我大學時學的就是物理
，在劍橋讀物理
。我認為物理很棒從中學到的知識
，可以為其他領域所用
。今天大家來聽的不是這個問題
，今天講的不是物理
。

So I paid for college doing online marketing, directions marketing. I started with SEO in the 1990s. I created a paper airplane site, and had a monopoly in the small niche market of paper airplanes. When you want to start a startup also see how big the market could be. (In the long term, it wasn’t great.) But what that taught me was how to do SEO. And back in those days it was Alta Vista, and the way to do SEO was to have white text, on a white background, five pages below the fold, and you would rank top of Alta Vista if you just said planes 20 or 30 times in that text. And that was how you won SEO in the 1990s. It was a really, really easy skill to learn.
我自費學習了大學網絡營銷課程直接營銷課程
，我從上世紀90年代開始接觸SEO（搜​​索引擎優化）
，我創立了一家紙飛機網站並壟斷了這個市場
，在紙飛機這個小眾市場
，有著壟斷地位
。當你準備創業的時候
，要從長遠角度考慮一下市場有多大紙飛機網站市場不大
，但是就是這個經歷教會了我如何做SEO
，當時用的搜索引擎是Altavista
。做SEO的方法是
，把白底白字的內容放在網頁下方不明顯的位置
，如果該文本中出現20到30個紙飛機字樣
，在Altavista搜索排名中就能佔首位
，上世紀90年代就是這樣做SEO的
，很容易上手
。
When I went to college, being a physicist, I thought paper airplanes would make me cool. I was actually the nerdiest person in the physics class, so I created a cocktail site, which was how I learned to program and that grew to be the largest cocktail site in the UK. That really got me into SEO properly when Google launched. So with Google you had to worry about page rank and getting links back to your site, which basically at that stage meant one link from the Yahoo directory, got you to the top listing in Google if you had white text and a white background below the fold as well.
我上大學時學的是物理專業
，當時我想紙飛機可以讓我變酷
，我當時是物理班上最書呆子的了
。所以我就創建了雞尾酒網站
，我就是在這個時候學習了編程
。那個網站後來發展成了英國最大的雞尾酒網站
，當Google嶄露頭角的時候上述經歷使​​得我做SEO游刃有餘
。在Google上做SEO時需要考慮網頁排名算法
，需要考慮有多少網頁鏈接到你的網站上。
此時
，如果雅虎黃頁鏈接了你的網站
，並且網頁底部也有白底白字的關鍵詞的話
，你的網站就可以在谷歌頁面排名中高居榜首。

When Google launched AdWords, that’s really when I started to do all my marketing. That meant buying paid clicks from Google and reselling them to eBay for a small margin of like 20% using their affiliate program. That was what really kicked me into overdrive, into doing what everyone nowadays talks about as growth, growth hacking or growth marketing. In my mind it’s just internet marketing using whatever channel you can to get whatever output you want, and that’s how I paid for college and that’s how I went from being a physicist to a Marketer - transitioning to the darkside of the force.
當谷歌有了關鍵字廣告
，此時我開始自己做生意
。也就是先從谷歌買下廣告鏈接
，再通過會員程序為eBay打廣告賺錢
，差不多能有20%的利潤
。這些經歷讓我率先進入了
，目前大家所說的
增長或是增長黑客領域
，在我看來就是網絡營銷而已
。利用各種渠道達到期望目標
，這就是我學營銷的經歷
。我本想成為一名物理學家結果成了營銷人士
，利用互聯網進行營銷

So what do you think matters most for growth? You’ve had tons of lectures, and people have said it over and over, so what do you guys think matters most for growth?
你們認為什麼對於增長最重要？你們聽過很多講座了這個話題被討論很多次了。你們認為什麼對於增長最重要？
告訴我個答案

Audience: Great product.
好產品

Schultz: What does a great product lead to?

好產品會帶來什麼呢？

Audience: Customers.
顧客
Schultz: And what do you need those customers to do?
顧客需要顧客做什麼呢？

Audience: Spread the word.
傳播口碑坐著回答就行

Schultz: Yes that’s it, retention. Retention is the single most important thing for growth. Now we have an awesome growth team at Facebook and I’m super proud to work in it, but the truth of the matter is, we have a fantastic product. Getting to work on growth of Facebook is a massive privilege because we are promoting something that everyone in the world really wants to use, which is absolutely incredible. If we can get people on, and get them ramped up, they stick on Facebook.
有人說用戶留存，對的
。用戶留存對於增長最重要
，目前Facebook有非常優秀的增長團隊
，能成為其中一員我非常榮幸
。重要的是我們有非常棒的產品
，Facebook的增長團隊發揮著關鍵作用
，因為我們推銷的產品
，全世界人民都想用
，這點非常贊。
一旦讓人們接觸到Facebook，他們就會愛上Facebook。

So many times, I got to advise multiple startups. My favorite was working with Airbnb, but I’ve worked with Coursera, I’ve worked with other ones that haven’t done as well as those guys. But the one thing that’s true, over and over again is, if you look at this curve, ‘percent monthly active’ versus ‘number of days from acquisition’, if you end up with a retention curve that is asymptotic to a line parallel to the X-axis, you have a viable business and you have product market fit for some subset of market. But most of the companies that you see fly up, we’ve talked about packing and virality and all of this stuff, their retention curve slopes down toward the axis, and in the end, intercepts the X-axis.
我給很多創業公司提供過諮詢服務
，我最得意的是與Airbnb的合作，我還跟Coursera合作過，
我還跟其他一些不如這幾家公司有名的一些公司合作過
。有一件事被反複印證
，那就是如果你看一下這條曲線
，用戶活躍度隨用戶獲取時間的變化
，如果你能得到
幾乎平行於x軸的用戶留存曲線
。那麼你的公司就是成功的
，你的產品適合一定的市場
，用戶數飛漲的大部分公司
，會使用增長黑客病毒式傳播和其他一些手段
。我盡量不罵他們但有時會忍不住
，他們的用戶留存曲線沿X軸下滑
，最終與X軸相交。

Now when I show this job to people, they say that’s all well and good, you had a million people a day in terms of growth, when you started the growth team at Facebook, or ‘you were at 50 million users, you had a lot of people join your site so you had a ton of data to do this.’ We used the same methodology for our B2B growth , getting people to sign-up for services advertisements, we used this to understand how much growth we were going to have in that market as well. And at that point when I joined Facebook, the product was three days old. And within 90 days of the product launching, we were able to use this technique to figure out what the one year value of an advertiser was, and we predicted it for the first year to 97%. So I think it’s very important to look at your retention curve.
當我把這個圖展示給別人看時
，大部分人說：不錯啊
。當你開創Facebook的增長小組時
，Facebook每天有100萬新用戶
，或是已經有了5000萬用戶
，有很多人訪問Facebook
。你有大量的數據進行統計
，我們把同樣的方法用在了B2B業務增長上
，吸引用戶註冊自助廣告服務
，我們用這種方法
，來分析我們在該市場中的增長
。

當時
，當我加入Facebook時該產品推出只有3天
，推出該產品90天后
，我們就能用這個方法來計算
，一位廣告商一年創造的價值
，我們預測出的數值
，是真實值的97​​%
。我認為觀察用戶留存曲線非常重要

If you see here, this red line is the ‘number of users’ who have been on your product for a certain number of days. So a bunch of people, will have been on the product at least one day, but if your product has been around for a year, you’ll have zero users who have been on it for 366 days. Make sense?
我們是這麼操作的
，大家看這裡
，紅色線表示：
使用產品一定時間的用戶數
。有些人或是說沒有人
，有些人一直使用你的產品
，所有的用戶至少有一天使用了你的產品
，如果你的產品推出一年了
，使用了366天的用戶數為零
。說得通嗎？好的

So what you then do is look for all of your users who have been on your product one day. What percentage of them are monthly active? 100% for the first 30 days obviously, because monthly active, they also end up on one day. But then you look at 31. Every single user on their 31st day after registration, what percentage of them are monthly active? Thirty-second day, thirty-third day, thirty-fourth day. And that allows you, with only 10,000 customers, to get a real idea of what this curve is going to look like for your product. And you’re going to be able to tell, is it asymptotic? It’ll get noisy towards the right side, like I’ m not using real data, but you’ll be able to get a handle on, whether this curve flattens out or does it not. If it doesn’t flatten out, don’t go into growth tactics, don’t do virality, don’t hire a growth hacker. Focus on getting product market fit, because in the end, as Sam said in the beginning of this course: idea, product, team, execution. If you don’t have a great product, there’s no point in executing more on growing it because it won’t grow. Number one problem I’ve seen, inside Facebook for new products, number one problem I’ve seen for startups, is they don’t actually have product market fit, when they think they do.
然後你這麼來看用戶數
，用戶至少使用了一天你的產品
，月度活躍用戶佔多大百分比呢？
顯然第一個月是100%
，因為第一個月只要是使用過一天的都算活躍的
，然後看第31天
，註冊31天后
，月度活躍用戶佔多大百分比呢？看第32天
，看第33天看第34天
這樣你就可以--
假設只有10000名用戶
，就能得到你的產品的
用戶留存曲線
。你就可以判斷其走向
，圖的右邊會有一些波動
，我用的不是真實數據
，圖的右邊會有一些波動
。不過你能看得出來
，線是不是平的
，如果不是平的就不要談什麼增長策略了
，不要談什麼病毒式增長不要雇增長黑客
，專心把產品搞好
。因為歸根結底如Sam在本課開始提到的
，創意產品團隊執行
，如果沒有好產品
，執行增長策略也沒什麼意義
，因為增長不了
。我在Facebook內部看到的
，我在合作過的創業公司中看到的
，最主要的問題是沒有好產品但是他們認為有
。
So the next question that people ask over and over again is, what does good retention look like? Sure! I can have 5% retention, but I’m guessing Facebook had better than that. That’s not going to be a successful business. I get really pissed off when people ask me that question, because I think you can figure it out. I love this story; this is like my one gratuitous story (link on powerpoint) that I’m throwing out here, so the rest of it may not be as gratuitous. But this is a picture that was published in Life Magazine in 1950 of one of the Trinity nuclear bomb tests. There’s a guy named Jeffrey Taylor. He was a British Physicist who ended up winning the Nobel Prize. He was able to figure out, from looking at this picture (picture on powerpoint) what the power of the U.S. atomic bomb was, and Russians were publishing similar pictures, just using dimensional reasoning. Dimensional reasoning was one of the best skills I learned during my time studying physics back in the UK.
下一個顯然的問題
，人們反復問的一個問題是
：好的用戶留存率什麼樣？
你可能說：我們公司只有5%的留存率
。（Facebook的留存率要好一些）
所以我們是失敗的
。當人們問我好的用戶留存率什麼樣時，我會生氣
，因為可以自己算啊
。我喜歡這個故事可能有點像“閒篇子”
，我在這裡給大家講講
，這個故事的後半部分比較有用
，這幅三位一體核試驗圖片發佈於
1950年的Life雜誌上
，有個叫Geoffrey Taylor的人，有同學知道Geoffrey Taylor嗎？
很棒，有人知道。
Geoffrey Taylor是一名英國物理學家
，他後來獲得了諾貝爾獎
，他能根據這幅圖片
求出原子彈的威力
。這是美國的一顆原子彈
，俄羅斯發布了相似的圖片
，不過是用因次推論做出來的
。這種技巧
，是我在英國讀物理時
學到的最好的方法
。
What dimensional reasoning is, you look at the dimensions that are involved in a problem, so you want to figure out energy, newtons, meters, newtons as a kilogram, meters seconds to minus two. You want to figure out kilograms, meters squared, seconds to minus two, and then you try to figure out how you can get each of those numbers from what data you have. The mass is the volume of this sphere, so that’s a meter cubed, so you’ve got meters to five over seconds to minus two and he was able to use that to figure out what the power of this atomic bomb was and what the ratios of the power between the Russian and the U.S. atomic bomb was, and essentially reveal one of the top secrets that existed in the world at that time.
其原理就是
，看一下問題中涉及的量綱
。如果想計算出能量
：能量等於牛頓·米
，牛頓等於千克·米/秒^2
，所以能量就等於千克·米^2/秒^2
。所以你就要算出
，其中各個值具體是多少
，此處的質量是球體的體積
，因此可以把米的立方代進去
，那麼就變成了能量等於米^5/秒^2
，能據此計算出
原子彈的威力
。
計算出俄羅斯和美國的原子彈的威力比
，從而解密了
當時世界的頂級機密
。
That’s a hard problem. Figuring out what Facebook’s retention rate is, is not a hard problem. How many people are there on the internet? 2.4 billion, 2.3 billion. Okay, Facebook is banned in China, so what now?
這個是很難的問題
，計算出Facebook的用戶留存並不困難
，全世界有多少網民？
說個大體數
，有人說24億有人說23億差不多就是這麼個數
，Facebook在中國是被禁的。那麼還有多少網民?

Audience: 2 billion.

約20億？

Schultz: So 2 billion people on the internet. Facebook said around 1.3 billion users in terms of active users. You can divide those numbers by each other. And yet that won’t give you the right answer. Of course not! But it’s going to give you close enough to a ballpark answer of what the retention rate looks like for Facebook. If we signed everyone on the internet up, then you will know it’s higher than that. Similarly, if you look at WhatsApp. They’ve announced 600 million active users. How many people have Smart Phones? You can figure out that number - that number is out knocking around. It can give you an idea of how many users there are. Amazon has a had a pop at signing up almost everyone in the United States. You know how many people are online in the United States, and you have a good idea of how many customers Amazon has from the numbers they throw out. Different verticals need different terminal retention rates for them to have successful businesses. If you’re on ecommerce and you’re retaining on a monthly active basis, like 20 to 30% of your users, you’re going to do very well. If you’re on social media, and the first batch of people signing up to your product are not like, 80% retained, you’re not going to have a massive social media site. So it really depends on the vertical you’re in, what the retention rates are. What you need to do is have the tools to think, ‘who out there is comparable’ and how you can look at it and say, ‘am I anywhere close to what real success looks like in this vertical?’
好的，20億網民
Facebook在上次收益報告中稱
，約有13億活躍用戶
，可以把兩個數相除
，結果是不准確的
。當然結果不准確
，但是可以讓你大體了解
，Facebook的用戶留存率
。如果把全世界網民都算上的話
，得出的結果要比剛才的數大一些
。同理如果看Whats App的話
，他們公司宣稱有6億活躍用戶
有多少人有智能手機呢？你可以估算出來
，這個數據比較好找
，從而可以大體知道有多少用戶
。Amazon很火
，幾乎所有美國人都註冊了
。你可以知道在美國有多少網民
，從他們公佈的數據
，可以推出亞馬遜有多少用戶存留
。公司類型不同
用於判斷公司是否成功的留存率標準也不同
，如果是電子商務公司
，月度活躍用戶有20%或30%的話
，公司經營得就很好
。如果是社交網絡公司
，第一批註冊用戶
，留存率不足80%的話
，該公司就不會火起來
。因此用戶留存率多少算成功
，得取決於評判標準
，你需要有一套方法
，找出可以進行比較的模板
，你可以以此為標尺
，看自己處於什麼位置才算成功了。
Retention is the single most important thing for growth and retention comes from having a great idea and a great product to back up that idea, and great product market fit. The way we look at, whether a product has great retention or not, is whether or not the users who install it, actually stay on it long-term, when you normalize on a cohort basis, and I think that’s a really good methodology for looking at your product and say ‘okay the first 100, the first 1,000, the first 10,000 people I get on this, will they be retained in the long-run?
因此用戶留存率對於增長最重要
，用戶留存來源於好創意
，將創意轉化為好產品並且產品適合市場
。看一個產品的留存率是否好
，使用同期群分析的話
，就要看註冊用戶
，是否長期使用
。一個好方法就是
，看產品的前100個用戶
，前1000個用戶前10000個用戶
，他們能被長期留住嗎？
So now, how do you attack operating for growth? Let’s say you have awesome product market fit. You’ve built an ecommerce site, and you have 60% of people coming back every single month, and making a purchase from you, which would be absolutely fantastic. How do you then take that, and say, ‘now it’s time to scale.’ (Now it’s time to execute was the last thing on your forum right? *to moderator*.) That’s where I think growth teams come in.
那麼如何進行增長？
假如你的產品有非常棒的市場
，你們是家電子商務公司
。每個月有60%的回頭客購買商品
，能做到這樣的話就很棒了
。你據此判斷是時候擴張了
，現在就到了前面講的最後一步——執行了
，此時是增長團隊進入的契機
。
My contrarian viewpoint is, if you're a startup, you shouldn't have a growth team. Startups should not have growth teams. The whole company should be the growth team. The CEO should be the head of growth. You need someone to set a North star for you about where the company wants to go, and that person needs to be the person leading the company, from my opinion, that's what I've seen. Mark is a fantastic example of that. Back when Facebook started, a lot of people were putting out their registered user numbers. Right? You'd see you registered user numbers for MySpace, you'd see a registered user numbers for ___11:38, you'd see registered user numbers. Mark put out monthly active users, as the number both internally he held everyone to, and said we need everyone on Facebook, but that means everyone active on Facebook, not everyone signed up on Facebook, so monthly active people was the number internally, and it was also the number he published externally. It was the number he made the whole world hold Facebook to, as a number that we cared about. If you look at what Jan has done with WhatsApp I think that's another great example. He always published sends numbers.
我的觀點與別人不同
，我認為初創業公司不需要增長團隊
，還是說錯話了
，不需要增長團隊。
初創業公司不需要專門的增長團隊
，整個團隊就是增長團隊
。CEO就是增長團隊的隊長
，你需要有人為你指明方向你需要一顆“北極星”
，這幅圖片來自NASA
，你需要有人為公司的發展
指明方向
。我認為
，這個人就是公司的領導人
，Mark就是很好的例子
，當Facebook面世時
，很多公司都在曬用戶數。
，你可以看到MySpace的註冊用戶數
，你可以看到Compact的註冊用戶數
。註冊用戶數隨處可見
，但是Mark曬的是月度活躍用戶數
，在公司內部他也要求大家以此為奮鬥目標
。他說的要讓大家都上Facebook
，指的是大家都在Facebook上活躍
，而不是讓大家都註冊Facebook
，月度活躍用戶數是Facebook內部關注的指標
，也是對外公佈的指標
。就是這個指標把全世界用戶吸引過來
，這個指標是我們所關心的數據
。
If you’re a messaging application, sends is probably the single most important number. If people use you once a day, maybe that’s great, but you’re not really their primary messaging mechanism, so Jan published the sends number. Inside Airbnb, they talk about ‘nights booked’ and also published that in all of the infographics you see in side TechCrunch. They always benchmark themselves against how many nights booked they have compared to the largest hotel chains in the world. They have at each of these companies, a different north star. The north star doesn’t have to be the number of active users for every different vertical. For eBay, it was gross merchandise volume. How much stuff did people actually buy through eBay? Everyone externally tends to judge eBay based on revenue. Actually, Benedict Evans has done this amazing breakdown of Amazon's business, which is really interesting to look at their marketplace business versus their direct business. So eBay is all marketplace business, right? So eBay's being judged by its revenue, when it actually has 10 times Gross Merchandise Volume going through the site. That was the number that eBay looked at when I was working there. Every different company when it thinks about growth, needs a different North star; however, when you are operating for growth it is critical that you have that North star, and you define as a leader.
Whats App的Jan
是另一個好例子
，Jan一直公佈的是發送信息數目
。發送量對於消息應用是
，最重要的
，如果用戶每天都用
，但是一天只發一條信息
。這樣的話你們家的應用應該不是該用戶最常用的
，因此Jan公佈的是消息數目
。Airbnb關心的是房間預定晚數
，他們公佈的也是這個數據
。例如在Tech Crunch上發布的數據圖
，他們公司總是與
，世界上最大的連鎖酒店的預定晚數進行比較
，不同的公司有不同的北極星
，北極星不一定是
，月度活躍用戶數
。對於eBay來說最關心的是成交額
，即顧客在eBay上實際買了多少錢的東西
，局外人傾向於用收入來評價eBay。

實際上
，Benedict Evans將Amazon的市場進行了完美的分析
，很有意思
，將第三方業務與自營業務進行對照
。EBay全是第三方業務
，雖然外界以收入來評判eBay
，但eBay實際的成交額是其十倍甚至以上
，成交額才是eBay內部關注
，並以此為奮鬥目標的
。關於增長不同的公司
，有不同的“北極星”
，在增長的操作過程中
，擁有並定義“北極星”
是很重要的
。
The reason this matters is, the second you have more than one person working on something, you cannot control what everyone else is doing. I promise you, having now hit 100 people I’m managing, I have no control. It’s all influence. It’s like I tell one person to do one thing, but the other 99 are going to do whatever they want. And the thing is, it’s not clear to everybody what the most important thing is for a company. It would be very easy for people inside eBay to say, ‘you know what? we should focus on revenue,’ or ‘we should focus on the number of people buying from us’ or ‘we should focus on how many people list items on eBay.’ And Pierre, and Meg, and John, those guys as various leaders, have always said ‘no, its the amount of Gross Merchandise Volume that goes through our site, the percentage of e-commerce that goes through our site, that is what really matters for this company. This means that when someone is having a conversation and you’re not in the room, or when they’re sitting in front of their computer screens, and thinking about how they built this particular project or this particular feature, in their head it’s going to be clear to them that it’s not about revenue, it’s about Gross Merchandise Volume, or it’s not about getting more registrations, registrations don’t matter, unless they become long-term active users. A great example of this was when I was at eBay in 2004, we changed they way we paid our affiliates for new users. Affiliate programs are a bit out of fashion these days, but the idea of an affiliate program is essentially, you pay anyone on the internet a referral for sending traffic to your site, but it’s mostly about getting access to big marketers who do it on their own.
北極星重要的原因是
，一旦公司的人數不止你一個
，你就不能夠控制其他每個人的行為
，我可以很確定地跟你講我現在管理著100個人
，我根本沒法控制他們每個人
。我可以給一個員工分配具體的任務
，但是其他的99名員工該干什麼就乾什麼
，什麼對於公司至關重要
，大家並不明確
。對於eBay來講
，大家可以關注收入
，可以關注出貨量
，可以關注
eBay上商品的數量
。Pierre Meg和John
是eBay的領導人
，他們說要以成交額為衡量標準
，還有我們網站在電子商務領域市場份額所佔的比率
，這對eBay來說才是最重要的
。
這就意味著其他人在開會
，有的員工沒有參與
。當這些人坐在電腦前
，思考要上架何種產品
，要添加何種特徵時
，他們頭腦清醒要以成交額為奮鬥目標
，而不是收入
，不以註冊用戶數為目標
。註冊用戶數不重要長期用戶才重要
用個例子來說明2004年我與eBay合作時
，我們改變了向合作網站支付的方式
，當時會員程序有點過時了
，會員程序的思想
，本質上就是 給增加你網站流量的貢獻者報酬，通常的做法是，鏈接到不同的大型的營銷網站上，這裡面有很多很好的故事。
We were paying for confirmed registered users, so all of our affiliates were lined up on getting confirmed registered users to the eBay site. We changed our payment model to pay for activated confirmed registered users. So you had to confirm your account and then bid on an item, or buy or list an item, to become someone that we paid for. Overnight when we made that change, we lost something like 20% of confirmed registered users that were being driven by the affiliates. But the ACRUs (15:45) only dropped by about 5%. The ratio between CRU to ACRU went up, and then, the growth of ACRUs massively accelerated. The cause of this is, if you want to drive CRU, if someone searches for a trampoline, you land them on the registration page because they link you have to register and confirm before they get their trampoline. If you want to drive ACRUs, you land them on the search results page, within eBay for trampolines, so they can see the thing they want to buy, get excited, and then register when they want to buy it. And if you drive just CRUs, people don’t have an amazing magic moment on eBay, when they visit the site. And that’s the next most important thing to think about: How do you drive to the magic moment that gets people hooked on your service.
用戶確認註冊後我們會支付報酬
，合作網站
爭相為我們推薦用戶
。後來我們改變了支付模式
，只有用戶確認註冊並使用網站服務後才付報酬
，用戶要確認註冊信息並在eBay上競價
，或是買東西或是拍賣東西這樣我們才給合作網站支付報酬
。我們做出改變之後一夜間
，合作網站推薦的確認註冊用戶
下降了20%
，但是活躍註冊用戶數（ACRU）只下降了5%
，註冊用戶數和活躍註冊用戶數的比值上升了
，並且ACRU的增長加快
，如果想增加確認註冊​​用戶數（CRU）可以這麼做。
如果有人搜索“蹦床”
，你就把他們引導到你們的註冊頁面上
，為了能獲取蹦床信息
，他們不得不註冊並確認。
如果你想增加ACRU，你就把他們引導到
，eBay的蹦床搜索頁面上
，他们看到了自己想买的东西
，很激动，所以立马注册并购买
，如果只是想增加CRU
，当顾客登录网站时，没有那种激动人心的时刻
，这就是要考虑的第2个重要的东西：
就是 ，如何制造激动时刻，
让顾客恋上你的网站。

In the lecture notes for this course, I’ve stuck in a bunch of links to people I think are brilliant at this stuff. For example, regarding the retention curve I showed you earlier, there’s a link to this guy Danny Ferante who is incredible talking about retention curves. The magic moment there are two videos linked: one is Chamath talking about growth, who is the guy who set up the growth team at Facebook, and the other, is my friend Naomi and I talking at f8 four years about how we were thinking about growth back then. In both of those videos, we talk about the magic moment. What do you think the magic moment is for when you’re signing up to Facebook?

在准备本课的讲义时
，有很多东西都很精彩，都想把链接给大家。
，我不知道如何取舍
，我前面介绍的留存曲线

几年前Mark在YC谈到过
Audience: See your friends.

Schultz: See your friends. Simple as that. I’ve talked to so many companies, and they try to get incredibly complicated about what they’re doing, but it is just as simple as when you see the first picture of one of your friends on Facebook, you go ‘Oh my God, this is what this site is about!’ Zuckerberg talked at Y Combinator about getting people to 10 friends in 14 days; that is why we focus on this metric. The number one most important thing in a social media site is connecting to your friends, because without that, you have a completely empty newsfeed, and clearly you’re not going to come back; you’ll never get any notifications, and you’ll never get any friends telling you about things they are missing on the site.

So for Facebook the magic moment, is that moment when you see your friend’s face, and everything we do on growth, if you look at the Linkedin registration flow, you look at the Twitter registration flow, or you look at what WhatsApp does when you sign up, the number one thing all these services look to do, is show you the people you want to follow, connect to, send messages to, as quickly as possible, because in this vertical, this is what matters. When you think about Airbnb or eBay, it’s about finding that unique item, that PEZ dispenser or broken laser pointer, that you really really cared about and want to get ahold of. Like when you see that collectible that you are missing, that is the real magic moment on eBay. When you look on Airbnb and you find that first listing, that cool house you can stay in, and when you go through the door, that’s a magic moment. Similarly on the other side, when you’re listing your house, that first time you get paid, is your magic moment or when you list an item on eBay, the first time you get paid, is your magic moment. You should ask Brian what he thinks, because they’ve done these amazing story boards which I think has been shared, about the journey through a user’s life on Airbnb and how exciting it is. He’ll be talking in around three lectures time; he’s awesome about talking about the magic moment, and getting users to feel the love, joy, and all this stuff.

Think about what the magic moment is for your product, and get people connected to it as fast as possible, because then you can move up where that blue line has asymptotic, and you can go from 60% retention to 70% retention easily if you can connect people with what makes them stick on your site.

The second thing to think about, that everyone in the Valley gets wrong is, we optimize when we think about growth for ourselves. My favorite example is notifications. Again, I’ve talked to and advised many different companies; every single company when they talk about notifications goes ‘Oh, I’m getting too many notifications, I think that’s what we have to optimize for on notifications.’ Okay, are your power users leaving your site because they’re getting too many notifications? No. Then why would you optimize that? They’re probably grown-ups and they can use filters.

What you need to focus on is the marginal user. The one person who doesn’t get a notification in a given day, month, or year. Building an awesome product is all about think about the power user, right? Building an incredible product is definitely optimizing it for the people who use your product the most, but when it comes to driving growth, people who are already using your product are not the ones you have to worry about. So in this Danny Ferante video there’s also talk about our growth accounting framework that we use to think about for growth. We looked at new users, resurrected users (people who weren’t on Facebook for 30 days and came back) and churned users. The resurrected and churned numbers for pretty much every product I’ve ever seen dominate the new user account once you reach a sensible point of growth a few years in. And all those users who are churning and resurrecting, had low friend counts, and didn’t find their friends so weren’t connected to the great stuff that was going on on Facebook. So the number one thing we needed to focus on, was getting them to those 10 friends, or whatever number of friends they needed. So think about the user on the margin; don’t think about where yourself (21:08), when you’re thinking about growth.

So for operating for growth, what you really need to think about, is what is the North star of your company: What is that one metric, where if everyone in your company is thinking about it and driving their product towards that metric and their actions towards moving that metric up, you know in the long-run your company will be successful. By the way, they’re all probably all correlated to each other, so it’s probably fine to pick almost any metric, whichever one you feel the best about, that aligns with your mission and your values - probably go for that one. But realistically, daily active users fairly correlate to monthly active users; we could have gone with either one. Amount of content shared, also correlates with how many users there are, because guess what? You add a user, they share content. So a lot of things end up being correlated. Pick the one that fits with you and know that you’re going to stick with for a long time. Just have a North Star, and know the magic moment that you know when a user experiences that, they will deliver on that metric for you on the North Star, and then think about the marginal user, don’t think about yourself. Those are, I think, the most important points when operating for growth. Everything has to come from the top.

So the last area is tactics. So let’s say you’ve found your niche market that you’re going to have a monopoly on inside the mousetrap market. It’s a silenced mousetrap fir sitting under beds, so if that the mice come to your bed overnight, they can be killed without waking you up. That’s your niche market. Your mousetrap is better than anybody else for that market. What typically happens in Silicon Valley is, everyone thinks marketers are useless. I thought marketers were useless when I was a Physics student, so I’m sure that you guys as Engineering students you must think that we’re awful people who aren’t useful to have around.

‘Build it and they will come.’ That is something that is very much the mantra in the Valley, and I don’t believe it’s true; I believe you actually have to work. There’s a good article in the lecture page from interviewing Ben Silverman. We talked about how the growth of Pinterest was driven by marketing. I’m biased of course.

The first tactic I want to talk about is internationalization. Facebook internationalized too late. Sheryl said it broadly in public and I definitely agree with that.

One of the biggest barriers to our long-term growth, and one of the biggest things we had to deal with, was all the countries where there were clones. Famously ? (23:55) had Fakebook.css in their HTML, and there were a ton of sites like that out there, whether it was ?, a clear clone, Mixie, Cyworld, Orkut; they were all these different social networks around the world that grew up when Facebook was focused around the U.S. Internationalizing was an important barrier we needed to knock down, and knocking down barriers is often important to think about for growth. Facebook started out as college-only, so every college that it was launched in was knocking down a barrier. When Facebook expanded beyond colleges to high schools, I wasn’t at the company, but that was a company-shaking moment where people questioned whether or not Facebook would survive,if the culture of the site could survive.

Then after, expanding from high schools to everyone - that was just before I joined - it was a shocking moment; that’s what spurred the growth up to 50 million, and then we hit a brick wall. When we hit that brick wall, that was when a lot of existential questions were being asked inside Facebook whether any social network could ever get to more than 100 million users. It sounds stupid now, but at that time, no one had ever achieved it. Everyone had tapped out between 50 and 100 million users, and we were worried that it wasn’t possible. That was the point at which the growth team got set up; Chamath brought a bunch of us together. He said very publicly he wanted to fire me on multiple occasions. Without Chamath, I think none of us would have stayed at the company; we were a really weird bunch of people - but it worked out. The two things we did, I think that really drove growth initially was, 1) We focused on that 10 friends in 14 days 2) Getting users to the magic moment. That was something that Zuck drove because we were all stuck in analysis paralysis and, ‘Is it causation? Is it correlation?’ Zuck would say ‘You really think that if no one gets a friend, that they’ll be active on Facebook? Are you crazy?’

The second thing was internationalization - knocking down another barrier. When we launched it, I think there were two things we did really well: 1) Even though we were late (and stressed about being late) we took the time to build it in a scalable way; we moved slow to move fast. You can actually view the full story from Naomi on one of the video links from the lecture page. What we did was draw all the strings on the site in FBT, which is our translation extraction script and then, we created the community translation platform, so we didn’t have just professional translators translating the site, but we could have all our users translating the site. We got French translated in 12 hours. We managed to get, to this day, 104 languages translated by Facebook for Facebook, 70 of those are translated by the community. We took the time to build something, that would enable us to scale.

The other thing is that we prioritized the right languages. Back then, the four main languages were French, Italian, German, and Spanish (and Chinese, but we are blocked in China). Now look at that list - that’s today’s distribution of languages. Italian isn’t on the list anymore; French and German are about to fall off. In the last year we quadrupled the number of people on Facebook in Hindi. Building for what the world is today is an easy mistake to make, and it’s a lot of what the other social networks did. We built a scalable translation infrastructure that actually enabled us to attack all of the languages, so we could be ready for where the future is going to be. You’ll probably be able to see some of our Internet.org summit in India about where we want to go with language translations.

These are the tactics I want to go through now: Virality, SEO, ESPN, SEM, Affiliates/referral programs. I think there are two ways to look at virality. There’s a great book by Adam L. Penenberg called the Viral Loop that goes through a bunch of case studies of companies that have grown through viral marketing. I strongly encourage you to read this book if you’re interested in viral marketing, as well as advertising. I think Ogilvy on Advertising is great as well because in the chapter 7 you can't think of anything else stick a car to billboard with super glue and people will buy the super glue. He has some really great creative tips. So virality. Sean Parker has this really great model that he told us about when I joined Facebook, which is to think about virality about a product, in terms of three things. First, is payload - so how many people can you hit with any given viral blast. Second, is conversion rate, and third is frequency. This gives you a fundamental idea of how viral a product is.

Hotmail is the canonical example of brilliant viral marketing. Back when Hotmail launched, there were a bunch of mail companies that had been funded and were throwing huge amounts of money at traditional advertising. Back in that time, people couldn’t get free email clients; they had to be tied to their ISP. Hotmail and a couple other companies launched, and their clients were available wherever you went. You could log-in via library internet or school internet, and be able to get access to that. It was a really big value proposition for anyone who wanted to access it. Most of the companies went out there and did big TV campaigns, billboard campaigns, or newspaper campaigns; however, the Hotmail team didn’t have much funding as they did, so they had to scramble around to figure out how to do it. What they did was add that little link at the bottom of every email that said, ‘Sent from Hotmail. Get your free email here.’

The interesting thing was that it meant that the payload was low: You email one person at a time, you’re not necessarily going to have a big payload. Maybe you send around one of those spam emails, but I’m not sure I’d click on your link. The frequency is high though, because you’re emailing the same people over and over, which means you’re going to hit those people once, twice, three times a day and really bring up the impressions. The conversion rate was also really high because people didn’t like being tied to their ISP email. So Hotmail ended up being extremely viral because it had high frequency and high conversion rates.

Another example is Paypal. Paypal is interesting because there are two sides to it, the buyer and the seller side. The other thing that is interesting is that its mechanism for viral growth is eBay. So you can use a lot of things for virality that may not look necessarily obviously viral. If you said to a seller that you were going to send them money - I can’t think of a higher conversion rate. Frequency was low, and payload was low. But Paypal did this thing where they gave away money when you got your friends to sign up, and that’s how they went viral on the consumer side. They didn’t have to do that for sellers, because if I said ‘I am going to send you money via this,’ you will take that. And even on the consumer side they went viral because if someone says ‘Sign up for this thing and you’ll get ten bucks.’ Why wouldn’t you? So they were able to go viral because their conversion rate was high on the buyer and the seller side, not because their payload and frequency was high. Make sense?

This is a really good way to look at virality if you want to say, ‘Is this product viral?’ Facebook was not viral via email sharing or anything like that. Facebook was purely viral via word of mouth. The interesting thing about Paypal and Hotmail, is to use them, the first person has to send an email to a person who wasn’t on the service. With Facebook, there is no native way to contact people who aren’t on the service. Everyone thinks that Facebook is a viral marketing success, but that’s actually not how it grew. It was word of mouth virality because it was an awesome product you wanted to tell your friends about.

Q: In the first round, it makes sense for there to be a low payload. Will the payload increase in later rounds as the campaign grows and people send more and more e-mails?

A: First and foremost, I think you only send emails to a small number of people. So compared to the massive viral engines that exist today, where you import someone’s entire contact book and send them all an e-mail, or where you post to everyone’s friends on Facebook, the actual payloads are still very small even if it’s everyone that you e-mail on a frequent basis you hit. I’m also thinking per email sent out, how many people are on it. But it’s a fair point that as more people get on Hotmail, they’ll send more emails, and as more people use email, the product grows more and more successfully.

Q: Does a point of conversion matter as well?

A: On Hotmail you click to sign up, but on a billboard you have to remember the URL, go to the website, type it in, find the registration button, click register and sign up. Anything you can do to move friction out of the flow, do it. Going from a billboard ad to an online ad removes huge amounts of friction from the flow.

Q: Are frequency and conversation rate related?

A: Absolutely. If you hit someone with the same email over and over again, or the same banner ad, the same rules apply to every channel. The more times you hit someone with the same Facebook ad, the less they’ll click. That’s why we have to, like creative exhaustion, rotate creatives on Facebook. Same with banner ads and news feed stories. The fiftieth time you see that IQ story on your news feed, you are not going to want to click on it. The same is true with these emails. So if you send the same email to people over and over again with an invite, you will get a lower conversion rate. ‘The more you hit someone with the same message, the less they convert’ is fundamental across every online marketing channel.

Second way to look at virality, which I think is awesome, is by this guy Ed. Ed runs the growth team at Uber now; he was at the growth team at Facebook. He was a Stanford MBA student, and did a class similar to this where they talked about virality and built viral products. The interesting thing is, if you look at Uber, they’re incredibly focused on drivers. It’s a two-sided market place, so they need drivers. It’s a huge part of their focus as a team, even though they’ve got probably the best viral guy in the world at the company.

So with virality, you get someone to contact import (35:12) let's say. Then the question is, how many of those people do you get to send imports? Then, to how many people? Then, how many click? How many sign up? And then how many of those import. So essentially you want people to sign up to your site to import their contacts. You want to then get them to send an invite to all of those contacts - ideally all of those contacts, not just some of them. Then you want a percentage of those to click and sign up. If you multiply all the percentages/numbers in every point in between the steps, this is essentially how you get to the point of ‘What is the K factor?’ For example, let’s says 100 people get an invite per person who imports, then of those, 10% click, and 50% sign up, and of those only 10 to 20% import, you’re going to be at 0.5 - 1.0 K factor, and you’re not going to be viral. A lot of things like Viddy were very good at pumping up stories. They got the factor over 1, which is perfectly doable. But if you’ve got something that doesn’t have high retention on the backend, it doesn’t really matter. You should look at your invite flow and say ‘okay, what is my equivalent to import, how many people per import are invites sent to, how many of those receive clicks, how many of those convert to my site, how many of those then import,’ in order to get an idea of you K factor. The real important thing is still to think about retention, not so much virality, and only do this after you have a large number of people retained on your product per person who signs up.

A couple more things we are going to touch on: SEO, emails, SMS, and push notifications.

In SEO, there are three things you need to think about. First one is keyword research. People do this badly all the time. So I launched this cocktail site I told you about, I spend a year optimizing it to rank for the word cocktail making, but it turns out in the UK, no one searches for cocktail making- about 500 a month; I dominated that search, it was awesome! 400 visitors a month, it was amazing. Everyone searches for cocktail recipes, and in the U.S., everyone searches for drink recipes. So I optimized for the wrong word. You have to do your research first about what you’re going to go after.

Research consists of, what do people search for that’s related to your site, how many people search for it, how many other people are ranking for it, and how valuable is it for you? Supply, demand, and value. So, do your keyword research to figure out which keyword you want to rank for. There are many great tools out there. Honestly the best one is still Google AdWords keyword planner tool.

Once you’ve done that, the next most important thing is links. Page ranks is essentially how all SEO is driven, and Google is based on authority. Now there’s a lot of other things in Google’s algorithm now, like, do people search for your website, there's a lot of stuff about what the distribution of what the anchor text is that’s sent to your site, so that if you abuse it or spam it, they can pop out with spam. White text on a white background five pages below the fold doesn't work anymore.

But the single most important thing is to get valuable links from high authority websites for you to rank in Google. Then you need to distribute that love inside your site by internally linking effectively. We launched SEO in September 2007; I joined Facebook November 2007. When we launched it, but we were getting no traffic from the pages we had launched, public user profiles. So when I went in and looked at it, the only way you could get into any public user profile was to click on the foot of the page for the about link, then click on the blog articles, then click on one of the authors, and then spider out through their friends to get all their friends.

Turns out that Google was like, ‘They bury these pages, they’re not very valuable. I’m not going to rank them.’ We made one change: We added a directory so that Google could quickly get to every page on the site, and we 100Xed SEO traffic. Very simple change drove a lot of upside by distributing the link love internally.

The last thing is that there’s a whole bunch of table stakes stuff for XML sitemaps, and making sure you have the right headers; it’s all covered really well online for you.

Email is dead for people under 25 in my opinion. Young people don’t use email. They use WhatsApp, SMS, SnapChat, Facebook; they don’t use email. If you’re targeting an older audience, email is still pretty successful. Email still works for distribution, but realistically, email is not great for teenagers - even people at universities. You know how much you use instant messaging apps, and how little you use emails. And you guys are probably on the high scale for email because you’re in Silicon Valley. That being said, on email the things to think about: Email, SMS, and Push Notifications all behave the same way. They all have questions of deliverability, so to finish to finish first, first you have to finish. Your email has to get to someone’s inbox. So if you send a lot of spam, end up with dirty IPs, or send email from shared servers where other people are sending spam from, you are going to end up being put in the spam folder consistently and your email will fail completely. You may end up being blocked and have your email bounce. There’s a lot of stuff around email where you have to look when you receive feedback from the servers you are sending emails to, 500 series errors versus 400 series errors; you have to be respectful how those are handled. If someone gives you a hard bounce, retry once or twice and then stop trying because if you are someone who abuses people’s inboxes, the email companies spam folder you, and it’s very hard to get out. If you get caught in a spam house link, or anything like that, it’s very hard to get out. It’s really important with email that you are a high class citizen, and that you do good work with email because you want to have deliverability for the long run.

That counts for push notifications and SMS, too. With SMS, you can go buy SMS traffic via grey routes with people who are having phones strung up attached to a computer and pumping out SMSs. That works for a time, but it always gets shut down. I’ve seen so many companies make these mistakes where they think they’re going to grow by using these kinds of tactics. If you can’t get your email, SMS, or Push Notification delivered, you will never get any success from these. You actually spam your power users and give them notifications they don’t care about, making it really hard for them to opt out. Well, they start blocking you, and you can never push them once they’ve opted out of your Push Notifications. And it’s very hard to prompt them to turn them on once they’ve turned them off.

So number one thing to think about regarding email, SMS, and Push Notifications is, you have to get them delivered. Beyond that, it’s a question of open rate, click rate. So what is the compelling subject line you can put there so the people can open your email, and how can you get them to click when they visit?

Everyone focuses towards doing marketing emails that are just spam in my opinion. Newsletters are stupid. Don’t do newsletters because you’ll send the same newsletter to everyone on your site. Someone who signed up to your site yesterday versus someone who’s been using your product for three years - do they need the same message? No.

The most effective email you can do is notifications. So what are you sending? What should you be notifying people of? This is a great place where we’re in the wrong mindset. As a Facebook user, I don’t want Facebook to email me about every ‘like’ I receive, because I receive a lot of them since I have a lot of Facebook friends. But as a new Facebook user, that first ‘like’ you receive is a magic moment. Turning on notifications throughout all of our channels, increased on our emails, SMS, and Push Notifications, but we only turned it on for low-engaged users who weren’t coming back to the site, so it wouldn’t be spamming for them.

So it was a great experience to think about that. The first thing you need to think about when sending emails, SMS, and Push Notifications is what notifications should we be sending. The second thing you need to be thinking about is how can you create great triggered marketing campaigns. When someone created their first cross-border trade transaction was one of the best email campaigns I was ever part of at eBay in terms of click through rate. It was awesome because it was really timely, and really in context - the right thing to do for the user.

I’d say make sure you have deliverability. Focus on notifications and triggered based emails, SMS, and Push Notifications.

There’s one thing I wanted to finish with, which is my favorite quote by General Patton. It’s so cliche; it’s crazy, but it’s awesome.

“A good plan, violently executed today, is better than a perfect plan tomorrow.”

And one other thing that Chamath instills in us and Mark still instills across the whole of Facebook is move fast and don’t be afraid to break stuff. If you can run more experiments than the next guy, if you can be hungry for growth, if you can fight and die for every extra user and you stay up late at night to get those extra users, to run those experiments, to get the data, and do it over and over and over again, you will grow faster.

Mark has said he thinks we won because we wanted it more, and I really believe that. We just worked really hard. It’s not like we’re crazy smart, or we’ve all done these crazy things before. We just worked really really hard, and we executed fast. I strongly encourage you to do that. Growth is optional.
