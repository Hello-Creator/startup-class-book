# Lecture 14: How to Operate 

I'm going to talk about how to operate. I have watched some of the prior classes and I am going to assume you have hired a bunch of relentlessly resourceful people, you have built a product that at least some people love, hopefully raised some capital, and now you are trying to build a company. You have been forging a product and now you are forging a company. And I would actually argue, forging a company is a lot harder than forging a product. Basic reason is people are irrational. We all know this. Either your parents, your significant other, your brother or sister, your teacher, somebody in your life is irrational. Building a company is basically like taking all the irrational people you know putting them in one building, and then living with them twelve hours a day at least. It's very challenging. Now there are some techniques for coping with that some people get good at it, some people don't. But that's really what operating is all about.

我今天講講應該怎樣運營一個公司
我看過前面的一些課程了
所以我假設你們已經
僱傭了一大幫機智的人才
你們已經做出來了一個至少有一部分粉絲的產品
同時已經融到了一些錢
現在你在試圖建立起一個公司
所以你們在繼續完善產品的同時
準備把公司做起來
我其實想說
做一個公司比做一個產品難多了
根本的原因在於人是非理性的
我們可能都知道不管是你的父母
你的伴侶你的兄弟姐妹
或者你的老師總是有人在你的生活中表現的不理性
打造一個公司就像是要把所有這些不理性的人
放在同一個屋子裡然後和他們一天至少生活12個小時
所以這件事非常具有挑戰性
處理這件事是有一些技巧可言的
有些人可以做的很好有些人卻不行
但是運營的本質就是有關這些技巧的


So basically what you are doing when building a company is building an engine. At first you have a drawing on a white board and you are architecting it, and it looks especially clean, beautiful, and pretty. But when you actually start translating it to practice it actually starts looking more like this and you're holding it together with duct tape. It takes a lot of effort from people to hold it together, that's why people work 80-100 hours a week. It's that heroic effort to keep this thing together because you don't actually, yet, have polished metal in place. Eventually you want to construct a very high performance machine. A machine that almost nobody really has to worry about every hour, every minute. And as we used to joke about at eBay, that if the Martians took over eBay it would take 6 months for the world to notice. That's eventually what you want to get to.

打造一個公司其實
就是打造一個引擎
一開始你先在白板上畫出大致的結構
開始建模
這個模型看起來乾淨漂亮美觀
但是當你真正開始實施的時候
卻會變成了這樣
你會不得不用膠布來固定這些部件
大家要花很大的力氣才能把整個結構
粘合在一起
這也是為什麼大家要每週工作80-100個小時
為了把這個結構粘合在一起
必須要花費一些精力
出現這樣的情況是因為你還沒有做好這件事的利器
最終你希望建造一架高效運轉的機器
一架基本上不用人花時間每時每刻
盯著的機器
就像我們原來拿eBay開玩笑一樣
就算是eBay被火星人佔領了
可能也會需要半年才會被人發現
這就是你會想要達到的狀態

As Warren Buffett says, build a company that idiots could run because eventually they will. So this is what you want. Basically a performance machine that idiots can run. Now as a leader, what is your real job, what's your role? Strictly speaking there is only one book ever written that actually explains how to do this. It's rather old, written in 1982 by Andy Grove, it's quite famous, and successful. And his definition of what your job is, is to maximize the output of the organization. Your organization that you are responsible for, so the CEO’s (responsible for) everything and VP would be a part of the organization, and the organizations around you. So if you are a VPE, you are actually responsible for the performance of the product team and the marketing team because you have influence there. So this is how you measure people, and you want to focus on the output and not the input. The old adage about measuring motion and confusing progress. You are measuring only progress. And this is going to sound like a fancy and glamorous thing to do. Maybe people get excited about managing a whole large organization and being “responsible” for the output. But in practice, what you are going to hopefully learn today is that it's more about things like ordering smoothies, teaching your receptionist how to answer your phone properly, and serving as a $10 an hour TaskRabbit for your employees. So let's talk about that.

或者像巴菲特說的一樣打造一個連傻瓜都能運營的公司
因為有一天肯定會有傻瓜接班
這就是你要做的
其實都是打造一個連傻瓜都能轉起來的機器
作為一個領導者你真正的工作是什麼？
你要扮演的角色是什麼？
嚴格來說只有一本書揭示了
如何做到上面說的而且這本書也有點老了
但是很成功也很出名
是1982年Andy Grove寫的
他對於你要做的工作的定義是
就是最大化公司的產出
你要對你的組織負責CEO需要對所有事情負責
VP都是公司組織的一部分而已
組織都圍著你如果你是公司副總裁
你事實上
對於產品團隊
和營銷團隊的表現負責因為你能影響他們
這也是你衡量大家工作的辦法
你要關注的是產出而不是衡量老話裡說的投入
不要衡量工作量不去懷疑工作量是否在增長
衡量進度就行了
這聽起來好像挺美好的
大家可能會覺得管理一個大組織\N67\N00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,​​390\N然後對它的產出負責會很讓人興奮\N68\N00:02:26,​​390 --> 00:02:28,450\N但事實上你今天要學到的是
類似於怎麼定奶昔之類的事
告訴你的前台怎麼接電話
然後給你的員工當10美元一小時的跑腿
現在我就來說說這個

So at first, when you start a company everything is going to feel like a mess. And it really should. If you have too much process, too much predictability, you are probably not innovating fast enough and creatively enough. So it should feel like everyday there is a new problem and what you are doing is fundamentally triaging. So some things will look like a problem, and they are actually colds, they are just going to go away. So somebody is annoyed about this or that, that is a cold, you shouldn't stress about it and you certainly should not allocate all your time to it. And some things are going to present themselves as colds, but just like in the emergency room if they are not diagnosed properly they can actually become fatal. What I am going to try to do is give you frameworks for thinking about when things are colds and when things are potentially fatal.

第一當你開始
建立一個公司的時候所有的事情都是一團糟
如果你的任務太多
很多可預測性那麼你可能
沒法很快的創新
所以你應該覺得每天都有新的問題冒出來
你在做的就是學會辨別
有些是事情看起來像是問題
但是其實不是他們都會自己好起來
有人因為這個那個感到很煩
但可能就是一個不值得關注的事情你不應該把重點放在這上面
你更不應該在這方面花時間
有些事情看起來像是不值​​得關注
但是就像在急診室如果他們沒有
診斷出正確的病症那麼結果將是致命的
我今天要說的就是盡我所能
給你們一個評判的框架
來判斷可能致命的問題

So one of the most important things I learned at Square is the concept of editing. And this is the best metaphor I have ever seen in 14 years of running stuff, of how to think about your job. It's a natural metaphor, so it's easy to take with you everyday and it's easy to transmit to each of your employees so they can figure out if they are editing or writing. It's a natural construct, you generally know when somebody asks you to do something, am I writing or am I editing? So an editor is the best metaphor for your job. And we are going to talk about the specific things you are doing in editing.

我在Square裡學到的最重要的事情之一
就是“編輯”
這是我在14年運營經驗裡看到的
關於如何思考你的工作的最好的比喻
這是一個很自然的比喻
所以你很容易就能記住
這也很容易教給
你的員工這樣他們就能分清楚
他們是在編輯還是在創作
這很生活化
你知道別人問你在做什麼的時候你要回答什麼
我是在創作還是在編輯？
編輯是對你工作最好的比喻
我們後面會再具體說編輯的細節
作為編輯首先要做的
也是你們都聽過或者在學校裡做過的
就是你把論文發給助教然後又發給你的朋友一片草稿

The first thing an editor does and you have all probably had this experience in school, is you submit a paper, to a TA, a draft to your friend, and the first thing that editor does is they take out a red pen, or nowadays you go online, and they start striking things. Basically eliminating things, the biggest task of an editor is to simplify, simplify, simplify and that usually means omitting things. So that's your job too, is to clarify and simplify for everybody on your team. The more you simplify, the better people will perform. People can not understand and keep track of a long complicated set of initiatives. So you have to distill it down to one, two, or three things and use a framework they can repeat, they can repeat without thinking about, they can repeat to their friends, they can repeat at night.

然後第一件編輯要做的事情
就是掏出他的紅筆或者像現在大家都上網
他們開始圈圈點點
基本上就是要各種刪
編輯最重要的工作就是精簡精簡
再精簡這通常意味著要忽略一些其他事情
這也是你的工作之一就是為你的團隊
澄清和簡化事情
你簡化的越多大家就能幹的越好
大家沒法每天
記著一大堆複雜的事情
所以你需要把這些都提煉成一二三點
然後用他們聽得懂的框架
這樣他們能很容易的理解
並且告訴他們的朋友
甚至晚上在家裡回想起來

Don't accept the excuse of complexity. A lot of people will tell you, this is too challenging, this is too complicated, yeah well I know other people simplify but that's not for me, this is a complicated business. They’re wrong. You can change the world in 140 characters. You can build the most important companies in history with a very simple to describe concept. You can market products in less than 50 characters. There is no reason why you can't build your company the same way. So force yourself to simply every initiative, every product, every marketing, everything you do. Basically take out that red and start eliminating stuff.

不要為複雜而找藉口
很多人會和你說
這很難很複雜
我知道有人會精簡
但是我不行
因為本來就是複雜的買賣
他們錯了
你們能用140個字符改變世界
史上那些重要的公司
都可以用非常簡單的方式來描述他們的概念
他們能用50個字符做好產品營銷
所以你沒有理由
不能把你的公司建立的和他們的一樣
所以你要強迫你自己簡化每一個想法
每一個產品每一次營銷和每一件你做的事情
現在就拿出你的紅筆
劃掉那些多餘的事情

Second thing editors do, is they ask you clarifying questions. When you present a paper to someone, what do they usually do? They find some ambiguity somewhere and ask, do you really mean this? Did you really mean that? Give me an example of this? That's what your job is. So you are in a meeting, people are going to look to you. And the real thing you do, is you ask a lot of questions. And they can be simple basic questions like should we try this seven days a week? Or six days? They can be fundamental questions like, where’s our competitive advantage here? We try to do this as investors too. Some investors will ask you a billion questions about a billion things and they will have you do diligence forever. We try to narrow down to, what are the one two three four things that matter most to this company? And only focus on those things. So it allows us to be more decisive and we can make decisions rapidly. It allows us not to distract you from your day job which is actually building a company. And yet still I think we get to the highest fidelity question because we don't have all these extra extraneous details and data. Now it's hard, it's something you have to practice. But when you get good at it, every step you eliminate, Andy Grove estimated you can improve performance by 30-50%.

第二件編輯要做的事情就是
他們會要你澄清一些問題
當你給別人講你的論文的時候
他們通常會做什麼？
他們會找到你含糊不清的地方
然後問你這到底是什麼意思你真的是這個意思嗎？
給我舉個例子？
這就是你的工作假設你正在開會
大家都看著你你真正要做的事情
就是你要問很多的問題
這些問題可以是很基本的問題
我們應該每週做七天？還是六天？
也可以是非常基本的問題
比如我們的競爭優勢在哪裡？
我們也會嘗試站在投資者的角度來做這件事
一些投資人會問各種各樣的問題
這會讓你保持長久勤奮的狀態
我們嘗試著縮小範圍
你認為對於公司來說最重要的兩三件事情是什麼？
然後就只專注於這些事情
所以這讓我們更加有決斷力
我們可以很快地作出決定
這讓我們不會在工作中分心
這才是在建立一家公司
我認為我們會達到更高的精準度
得到更精準的答案
因為我們沒法弄到所有額外的數據
以及一些來自外部的數據細節
現在看起來很困難這是你必須去不斷實踐練習的東西
但是當你逐漸熟練開始擅長精簡每一步驟
按照Andy grove的估計你可以提高30%到50%效率


Now the next thing you do is you allocate resources. So the editor construct, this is what editors do all the time. They take editors from the Mideast, covering the Mideast and they move them to Silicon Valley, because Silicon Valley is more interesting. Or they move them to the sports section because they want to compete on the basis of sports journals and other publications. So that can be top down, where I take a whole bunch of resources and people and say, we are now going over here. We are going to compete on this basis. Then next month, next quarter, next year well that Middle East coverage is getting boring, we don't want to do that anymore. Let's go chase after something else. Or it can be bottom up, just like journalists mostly come up with their own stories.

現在你要做的下一件事是分配資源
也就是編輯結構
這便是編輯們一直以來在做的事情
他們從中東帶來編輯
報導整個中東地區然後帶他們去矽谷
因為矽谷更加有趣
或者是帶他們去體育界因為他們想要以
體育報導或其他出版物為基礎進行競爭
所以他們可能是自上而下的決策首先我帶著
許多資源和人
我們來到了這裡
我們將在此展開競爭
到了下個月下個季度下一年
直到中東的報導令人無聊為止
那時候我們便再也不想做了
我們來做些別的事情或者可以是自下而上的
就像記者們大都能獨立寫出故事一樣

The people who work with you, generally, should be coming up with their own initiatives. So a reporter, generally, who covers Google will come up with the interesting stories that they are hearing in ether and propose one or two to their editor for approval. But it's not the editor saying, go cover Google and this is the angle I want. Once in a while they do that, but its not the meat and potatoes of what a journalist does every day. Your goal over time is to use less red ink every day. So one way of measuring how well you are doing at communicating or talking to your colleagues about what's important and what's not, about why some things are important and why some things are not. It's how much red ink you are pulling out in a day, it's okay if you are having a bad day and the red ink is all over the place. But it's not okay if the red ink next month is more than it was last month, and next quarter more than this, so measure yourself by how much red ink you’re creating.

那些和你一起工作的人
應該也能夠獨立得出自己的想法
所以一名報導Google的記者會想出
把他們在各處聽到的事寫成有意思的股市
挑出一兩個故事給編輯審閱
但這不是編輯說了算“你去報導Google吧
這是我想要的角度”
當然有的時候也會這樣
但是這不是記者工作的常態
但是這不是記者工作的常態
你的目標是每天盡量少的使用紅筆
所以衡量你和你的同事們在事情的輕重緩急上
以及在為什麼有些事更重要
而另一些事沒那麼重要上的溝通
是否良好的方法是
看你每天用掉多少紅墨水
如果你有個很糟糕的一天沒有關係
用紅筆糾正一下就好了
但是如果下個月需要糾正的量
比這個月還多
比下個季度比這個季度還多的話都是不行的
所以通過你使用了多少紅墨水來衡量你自己吧

The other thing that is very important that actually isn't as intuitive to a lot of people, is the job of an editor is to ensure consistent voice. So if any of you read The Economist, you can tell that there is one consistent voice. You can pick up any article, any post in The Economist and it feels like it was written by the same person. Ideally, your company should feel, on your website, on PR releases, on your packaging if it's a physical product, anywhere on your recruiting pages it should feel like it was written by one person. That's extremely difficult to do. And at first you are going to be tempted to do that yourself, which is okay for a founder to do that him or herself initially. Over time you do not want to be doing all of the consistent voice editing by yourself. You want to train people so they can recognize differences in voice.

另外一件並不符合很多人的直覺
但是卻很重要的事
編輯的一大職責就是保持文風一致
所以如果你們當中的任何人讀過《經濟學家》
你會發現他們的論調一直很穩定
你可以隨便拿一篇文章一個帖子
你會感覺到甚至像是一個人寫的
理想狀態下你的公司就應該是這種感覺
在你們的網站上以及你們發布的報告中
如果是實物產品那麼也應該體現在包裝上
你的招聘頁面也該如此應該讓人感覺
都是出自一人之手
其實這是一件非常困難的事情
首先你要做的是自己來做這件事
創始人從自己開始做這件事
是完全沒有任何問題的
但是時間久了不想自己一個人完成
所有統一風格的編輯工作
你訓練有素
所以人們能辨別出風格上的不同


See this website page, it looks very different than this recruiting page. You start asking questions, why is that? Is the reporting messed up? Is one of the leaders over here not really understanding the voice of the company? You have to fix that over time, but you want to start with the objective that everything should feel the same. It's quite difficult to practice, almost every company has one piece of the organization that isn't on the same voice. At Apple, which is notorious, even under Steve's regime, which is notorious for getting this right, if you asked someone who worked at Apple, asked them about the internal tools about recruiting, do they really feel like Apple products? All of them will tell you no. So you are never 100%. But you definitely want to get as close to that as you can.

看看這個網頁
他與招聘頁面比起來看起來非常不同
你就會問為什麼會這樣
是不是這個報告寫砸了
是不是這個部門的領導
沒有真正了解公司的風格？
你需要花很多時間去解決這種問題
但是你要帶著“一切都會趨同”的目標去開始
但是你要帶著“一切都會趨同”的目標去開始
事實上這個實踐起來非常困難
幾乎所有公司都會有至少一個部分
是與整體風格不一致的
最典型的例子就是蘋果
即使是在喬布斯的統治之下也是這樣
如果你問一個蘋果的僱員
關於他們內部使用的招聘工具
這些工具用起來像是蘋果的產品嗎？
他們所有人會告訴你不像
完美是做不到的
但是你肯定會希望盡可能的完美

Next complicated topic is delegating. So just like the other metaphor on editing is writers do most of the work in the world, editors are not writing most of the content in any publication. So that is true of your company, you shouldn't be doing most of the work. And the way you get out of most of the work, is you delegate. Now the problem with delegating is that you are actually responsible for everything. The CEO, founder, there is no excuse. There is no, there is that department over there, this person over there screwed up. You are always responsible for every single thing, especially when things go wrong. So how do you both delegate but not abdicate? It's a pretty tricky challenge, both are sins. You over delegate and you abdicate, or you micromanage, those are both sins. So I'm going to give you a couple techniques for solving this.

下一個複雜的話題是委派代表的問題
就和我喜歡編輯的這個比喻的
另一個原因一樣
絕大多數的工作是作者來做的
任何出版物中的大多數內容實際不是編輯們寫的
所以他也適用於你的公司
你不用親自做大部分的工作
你也不應該去做大部分的工作
你應該讓你的委託人做大部分的工作
你應該讓你的委託人做大部分的工作
而委託人帶來的問題是
事實上還是你在負責所有事
作為CEO 你責無旁貸
你不能說那個部門
或者誰誰誰把事情搞砸了
你要為所有的小事負責
尤其是出了問題的時候
所以你要怎麼做到分權但不推卸責任
這是一個非常棘手的挑戰
兩邊做不好都是大錯比如你分權過度
或者太集權
或者是管的很細這些都是不對的
所以我將要給你們幾種解決這種問題的方法

First, and this actually came from High Output Management and Andy Grove, is called task relevant maturity. It's a fancy phrase for, has this person ever done this before? It's really simple, how mature is this person in doing something? And the more they have done the exact same task before, the more rope you are going to give them. And the more they are trying something new, the more you are going to instruct them and constantly monitor. This is a basic concept but it's worth keeping in the back of your brain. The interesting implication, and this is pretty radical, is that any executive, any CEO, should not have one management style. Your management style should be dictated by your employee. So with one particular person, you may be very much a micromanager because they are quite low on this scale. And with another person,, you may be delegating a lot because they are quite mature on this scale.

第一個方法叫做“相關任務的熟練度”
這實際上是來自高輸出管理和發展
這是一個很新潮的短語
就是問這個人有做過相關工作的經驗嗎？
這很簡單
這個人在某項工作上的熟練度如何
在同樣任務上的經驗越多
就可以給他們越多自由的空間
如果才剛開始做新的嘗試
就少放權更多的引導他們
持續監控
這是一個基本型的概念
但是很值得銘刻在你大腦中
特別有趣的一件事是
實際上真的有點激進就是任何一個執行管理人員
任何CEO不應該只有一個管理風格
你的管理風格應該由你的僱員決定
所以對於一個特定人員你可能是個細節管理者
因為他們本身在領域內的能力不夠
對於另外一個人來說你可能喜歡放權
因為他們在這方面很成熟

So it's actually a good thing if you do reference checks on somebody and half the people you call say they are a micromanager and the other half say they actually give me a lot of responsibility. That's a feature not a bug. I didn't understand that at first at all. I used to be befuddled when people would do reference checks on me and come back with this complicated mosaic. Then I finally figured out that maybe I was doing my job correctly. So then I taught others that this is the way to do it.

所以如果你對某人做背景調查的時候
你會發現一部分人說他是細節管理者
另一部分人會說他們實際上給了我
很大的權力實際上這是一件好事
這不是一個錯誤
我最初並不能理解
一度有人對我做背景調查的時候
我都很迷茫以至於產生了這種複雜的想法
最後我明白了
實際上我的工作做的還不錯
所以
我也明白了別人為什麼這麼做
一個更加微妙的答案是我想出來的


A more nuanced answer that I came up with, is how to make decisions. Delegating vs doing it yourself. You don't want to do it yourself too often. So I basically borrowed from Peter, this is my first two by two matrix ever in my life, but he taught me something at least. You basically sort your own level of conviction about a decision on a grate, extremely high or extremely low. There's times when you know something is a mistake and there's times when you wouldn't really do it that way but you have no idea whether it's the right or wrong answer. And then there is a consequence dimension. There are things that if you make the wrong decision are very catastrophic to your company and you will fail. There are things that are pretty low impact. At the end of the day they aren't really going to make a big difference, at least initially.

關於如何決策的問題
是放權還是親力親為
你不想都是自己在做
所以我從Peter那裡借鑒
這是我人生一生中第一個2x2的矩陣
但是Peter確實教給我了一些東西
將你對一項決策的確信程度按照極高和極低的分類方式
分佈在網格中
有時候當你知道某件事是個錯誤
有時候其實你不想這麼做
但是你也不知道
這到底是對的還是錯的
但是這裡有個必須提及的結論
如果你做出了錯誤的決定
那麼對你的公司是災難性的你可能會因此失敗
也有一些事情影響很小微乎其微
他們不會造成大的影響
至少最初不會有什麼大的問題


So what I basically believe is where there is low consequence and you have very low confidence in your own opinion, you should absolutely delegate. And delegate completely, let people make mistakes and learn. On the other side, obviously where the consequences are dramatic and you have extremely high conviction that you are right, you actually can't let your junior colleague make a mistake. You're ultimately responsible for that mistake and it's really important. You just can't allow that to happen. Now the best way to do that is to actually explain your thinking why. It's easy to shortcut when you get busy explaining ways in the world but it's very important to try.

所以我比較認同的觀點是
那些你自己也沒有把握而且影響很小的事情
你該放權就放權
讓員工去犯錯然後從中學習
從另一個方面說
對於那些戲劇性的結果
你很自信你認為自己是對的
那就別讓你的員工去拿這些試錯了
畢竟最終你還是要為這種錯誤負責
如果這事真的很重要你就不能讓那些發生
現在防止它發生的最好的方法\N337\N00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,​​140\N是真正地去解釋清楚你的想法以及為什麼會這麼想\N338\N00:12:26,​​140 --> 00:12:27,680\N當你忙著解釋各種事情的時候就會容易找捷徑
也很容易忽視對原因的解釋但是這個真的很重要


When I was at LinkedIn, I had a colleague that was quite, quite talented but occasionally would get annoyed if I did not agree with his opinion on something. So I would spend a lot of time trying to persuade him why I was making a decision a certain way. And his wild card, his card he would call out if I didn't quite persuade him was, okay you're the boss. And that to me was like I was burning a lot of social capital. Every time he said that I knew I was creating a really thin line and ultimately that was going to backfire if I did that too often. You want to track the times that you are doing that.

當我在LinkedIn的時候我有一個很有天賦的同事
如果我不同意他的某一看法時
我們可能雙方都會覺得很不爽
我就會花費很多時間嘗試去勸服他
我為什麼會那麼做為什麼會做出那樣的決定
如果我一直不停的話
他最後就會出他的殺手鐧
他會說“好吧由你決定你才是boss” 那個對我來說
就像是我浪費了很多社會資源
每次他這麼說
我就會意識到我在冒險
如果老這麼做的話可能會適得其反
所以我會希望自己記錄下我自己這麼做過多少次


An example of this is at Square, one of my favorite people in the world and my second hire, first marketing hire, had this program he wanted to run called Inner Square which allowed Square merchants to give out, imagine a food truck outside put out ten Squares on the counter and people could just grab them. And Kyle had this great idea that this would be an awesome marketing program. Squares would spread Squares to other people and to some extent it was on brand. So it didn't have catastrophic consequences. Each of these ten Squares didn't cost that much money, so financially we could afford to do it. But at that time, my ten years of experience said it was not going to work on a meaningful enough scale for our metrics and I preferred not to do it. Kyle was so excited about this that I decided to just let him do it. He learned that when you measure this thing, it's not massive. It doesn't create massive value for the company. It did require a fair amount of operational complexity to ship all these Squares to people and figure out how to get them, etc, etc. But it allowed him to be excited about his job and to learn how to filter future ideas. So it was totally worth letting him make the “Mistake."

一個在Squares的例子
一個我世界上最喜歡的人
他也是我第二個僱員這個項目在第一次做市場推廣的時候
他想把這個運營的項目命名為Inner-Square
這個方案讓那些決定註冊成為Square的商家
能夠得到10個Square
想像一下外面有輛外賣車
結賬的地方恰巧有10個Square 這樣人們就可以直接用來結賬了
Kyle想出了這個絕妙的主意
這會是一個非常好的營銷方案
在人群中推廣Square
一定程度上要依賴於這個品牌
所以這個方案不會造成任何致命性的後果
每一個都沒有那麼大的成本
財政上完全可以負擔
但是那時候我的十年經驗告訴我
這個方法固然有效
但是不會讓我們的用戶數量發生質的變化
所以事實上我並不是很傾向於這個方案
Kyle對這個項目抱有極大的信息
所以我決定讓他放手去做
當要做的時候他也發現
其實這個營銷的效果並不是那麼驚人
它並不能為公司帶來巨大的價值
而且把Square配送給用戶
以至讓他們發展成為Square用戶的方法
卻非常的複雜工作量也非常繁重
但是他對這次的工作非常的有激情
也讓他學到了以後如何去篩選各種方案
所以放手讓他去犯錯誤是很值得的

The next and most important thing you do is edit the team. So these are the people you work with. Nobody is going to have a perfect team and you certainly aren't going to start that way. So what I am going to try to do is maximize the probability of success in editing the team. So I like this idea of barrels and ammunition. Most companies, when they get into hiring mode, as Sam pointed out you should defer that a bit, but when you do just hire a lot of people, you expect that when you add more people your horsepower or your velocity of shipping things is going to increase. Turns out it doesn't work that way. When you hire more engineers you don't get that much more done. You actually sometimes get less done. You hire more designers, you definitely don't get more done, you get less done in a day.

The reason why is because most great people actually are ammunition. But what you need in your company are barrels. And you can only shoot through the unique barrels that you have. That's how the velocity of your company improves is having barrels. Then you stock them with ammunition, then you can do a lot. You go from one barrel company, which is mostly how you start, to a two barrel company and you get twice as many things done in a day, per week, per quarter. If you go to three barrels, great. If you go to four barrels, awesome. Barrels are very difficult to find. But when you have them, give them lots of equity. Promote them, take them to dinner every week, because they are virtually irreplaceable because they are also very culturally specific. So a barrel at one company may not be a barrel at another company.

下一個你要做的很重要的事情
是去編輯你的團隊
這些是你與之共事的人
沒有什麼團隊是完美的
你也不會一開始就是個完美的團隊
所以我將要做的事情
就是將編輯團隊做到最大的成功
我喜歡Barrels and Ammunition這幅畫的理念\N391\N00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36​​,878\N大多數的公司一旦進入僱傭模式\N392\N00:14:36​​,878 --> 00:14:39,113\N就像是Sam說過的那樣你可以相對的拖延一下
但是一旦開始了你就會僱傭很多人
你期待著
隨著僱傭人數的增加
你的生產力馬力速度
或者出貨速度都會變得更好
但事實證明並不是那樣
當你僱傭了更多工程師時
你並沒有完成那麼多事情
相反可能實際上完成的更少了
你僱傭了更多的設計師
你也沒有完成的更多\N404\N00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:0​​1,200\N而且你每天做的更少了我們會談論下這件事的原因\N405\N00:15:0​​1,200 --> 00:15:0​​4,290\N這件事的原因\N406\N00:15:0​​4,290 --> 00:15:0​​7,540\N在於大多數偉大的人都是火藥\N407\N00:15:0​​7,540 --> 00:15:0​​9,320\N但是你在公司裡面需要的人實際上是槍筒\N408\N00:15:0​​9,320 --> 00:15:10,960\N你有多少火藥
才能開多少槍
所以要提高公司的運轉速度是僱傭槍筒
然後把槍筒裡裝上火藥
這樣你才能所向披靡
公司開始創建是時候通常只有一隻槍筒
這也是你最有可能開始的方式
等變成有兩隻槍筒的公司的時候
你每天每星期每季度的產量都會翻倍如果你公司擁有
三隻槍筒那麼就太棒了四隻槍筒那就相當牛X了
因為找到槍筒是一件很難的事情
一旦你找到那麼就想盡辦法去留住吧
各種去提拔他們請他們去吃飯
因為他們是不可替代的
由於這些人對公司文化極為敏感
所以如果他到了另外一家公司可能就不是現在這樣了

One of the ways, the definition of a barrel is, they can take an idea from conception and take it all the way to shipping and bring people with them. And that's a very cultural skill set. Two questions are probably occurring to you. How can you tell who is a barrel and who is not? One is you start with a very small set of responsibilities, it can be very trivial. It can be something like, I want to reward the engineers in my office at nine o'clock every night with a nice cold, fresh smoothie. This is actually a real example. I was frustrated, our engineers were working really hard, and maybe 20%, 30% would stay late in the evening and we had already served them dinner but I wanted to give them something cool to reward them. You can think about alcohol but that's a little complicated. So smoothies were probably a little bit better than pizza, which drains you of energy. But nobody could get smoothies to show up in my office at nine o'clock sharp, that were cold, that tasted good, and that were delivered in the right place that the engineers would find them.

因為這些人能夠成為槍筒的原因是
他們可以從概念中提取出一個點子\N426\N00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53​​,410\N然後把它做成一個產品讓大家跟著他一起做\N427\N00:15:53​​,410 --> 00:15:57,230\N這是一種很明顯的文化特性機會特性
或者說兩者都有
這樣的話有兩個問題將會發生在你的身上
你怎麼分辨出槍筒呢？誰是？誰不是？
其一是你可以開始讓他們承擔一些小責任
可以是不怎麼重要的任務
它可以是“我想要
獎勵每晚九點還在公司的工程師
吃一杯很好吃的奶昔”
這是一個真實的例子
我們Square的工程師工作真的很努力為此我曾經一度糾結
可能有百分之20-30的人會熬夜工作
所以我們會為他們提供晚餐
但是我還是想獎勵他們一些很酷的東西
你可能想到酒
但是工作時候喝酒好像不太好
所以奶昔比披薩要好一點
因為披薩會消耗你的能量
我希望晚上九點的時候那些冰涼清爽的奶昔
能夠出現在工程師們隨處可以拿到的地方
但是事實上沒有人能搞定這件事

You would think this is simple but in fact it took two months to get this done. So we had an intern start, and I think on his second day I was explaining this problem, and he said, well I will do it. And I was looking at him like there was no way. I have seen my office manager fail, my assistant fail, who were actually pretty good. This just isn't going to happen. And low and behold they show up. On time, cold, delivered at the right place, and my first instinct was great. Nothing about the smoothies, but now I can actually give him something more important that is more complicated to do.

你會認為這很簡單
但是實際上我花了兩個月來完成
所以我們招聘了一名實習生
在他工作的第二天
我跟他說了這個問題
他答應了說沒問題他來搞定我看著他也沒有別的方法
就決定讓他一試
我的辦公室經理失敗了我的助理失敗了
這些都是原來很不錯的人
我認為實習生也不會搞定
但是那天晚上冰涼清爽的奶昔準時在規定的地方出現了
我覺得太​​棒了但是這種感覺
與奶昔無關
現在我可以真正地給他一些更重要的
更複雜的事情去處理了

And that's actually what you want to do with every since employee, every single day, is expand the scope of responsibilities until it breaks. And it will break, everybody, I couldn't run the world, everybody has some level of complexity that they can handle. And what you want to do is keep expanding it until you see where it breaks and that's the role they should stay in. That level of sophistication. But some people will surprise you. There will be some people that you do not expect. With different backgrounds, without a lot of experience that can just handle enormously complicated tasks. So keep testing that and pushing the envelope. The other signal to look for is once you've hired someone, with an open office, just watch who goes up to other people's desks. Particularly people they don't report to. If someone keeps going to some individual employees desk and they don't report them, it's a sign that they believe that person can help them. So if you see that consistently, those are your barrels. Just promote them, give them as much opportunity as you can.

所以你期望的其實是
每天都去拓展每位員工的責任
直到他們無法勝任因為每個人都會有極限
沒人能統治整個世界
每個人都有一些自己擅長的領域
你想要做的就是一直擴張它直到你看到
他們hold不住了那裡就是他們應該保持的角色
但是一些人會令你驚奇
總會有一些你根本沒有期待的人
帶著不同的背景
也沒有很多處理疑難任務的經驗
那就持續地考驗他們讓他們去挑戰極限
你僱傭到
這種類型人的時候還有一種信號你只需要觀察
在開放的辦公室裡看看有誰會走向其他人的辦公桌
尤其是跑到那些不是他的直接領導的辦公桌前
如果有人走到你的辦公桌前
到一些個別員工的辦公桌前
而他們並不是跟你或者跟這些員工匯報
那是那些人覺得
那個人能夠幫助他們
如果你持續看到這種現像他們就是你的槍筒了
放心去提拔他們
盡可能地給予他們更多的機會

The other question everybody asks about people is when do you hire somebody above somebody. And when do you mentor somebody, and when do you replace somebody? And the way to think about this is that every company has their own growth rate, and every individual has their own growth rate. So some companies that are very successful, lets say LinkedIn. LinkedIn was always a very linear company, it never went like this. So for example I joined LInkedIn 18 months after we launched and we only had 1.5 million users. Which for a social product is a very small number. And when I joined I was the twenty-seventh employee, and when I left two and a half years later they only had fifty-seven employees. In contrast, when I joined Square as the twentieth employee, two and a half years later we had two hundred fifty-three employees.

另一個人人都問的問題是
你什麼時候僱傭職位更高的人？
什麼時候要給某些人一些指導
你什麼時候要讓一個人取代另一個人？
去思考這個問題的方式是
每一個公司都有他們自己的成長速度
每一個人都有他們自己的成長速度
所以有一些非常成功的公司
例如LinkedIn
LinkedIn是一個線性的公司
它的走勢從來都沒有這樣過
所以例如我是在正式發布產品18個月以後加入了LinkedIn
我們只有150萬的用戶
這對於一個社交產品來說這個數目太小了
當我加入的時我是第27名員工
當我兩年半離開之後
我們也只有57個員工
相比之下當我作為第20個員工加入Square之後
2年半之後我們已經有了250300個雇主


So each company has it's own velocity on this curve. So if the company is going like this, you can only keep people on the roles if their own learning curve is going like this. On the other hand, if your learning curve is like this, anyone learning faster than that, you can give them the same roles as they do. So always track the individual slope of employee and the company growth rate. Now that you have your barrels figured out, and you can identify people who can take ideas that you have in the back of your head, scope it out, run with it, ship it, and it's perfect. Where do you aim these barrels?

所以每個公司都有它自己的成長速度
如果在公司的曲線是這樣的
你只可以讓人們老老實實的在自己的崗位上呆著
而員工的個人成長曲線是這樣的
相反如果一家公司的成長曲線是這樣的
那麼對於任何個人成長曲線比公司曲線快的員工
你可以不斷給他新的職責
所以跟踪記錄每個人的發展速度
和公司成長速度
現在既然你知道了槍筒是誰
把他們挖掘出來把你腦子裡的點子
告訴他們
讓他們定出範圍運行發生塑造
一切都很完美你對這些槍筒設定的目標是什麼

So I am going to argue that you need to spend a lot of time focusing on people. This is something I learned from Peter Thiel actually. He used to insist at PayPal that every single person could only do exactly one thing. And we all rebelled, every single person in the company rebelled to this idea. Because it's so unnatural, it's so different than other companies where people wanted to do multiple things, especially as you get more senior, you definitely want to do more things and you feel insulted to be asked to do just one thing.

我要告訴你你需要花費
更多的時間專注於員工
這是一些我從Peter Thiel那裡學到的東西
他曾經在Paypal內部堅持一個信條認為每一個人
都只能做一件事但是我們都反對這麼做
每一個人都反對這個理念
因為這太反常了這與其他公司人們想做
很多不一樣的事情不一樣
尤其是當你職位更高的時候
你當然想要做更多的事情
當你被要求只做一件事情的時候你會認為被侮辱了
但是Peter會很嚴格地執行這項決定
他會說除了分配給你​​的任務外
我不會和你談其他事情
我不想听到你在那邊做的有多好
少說話好好做你該做的其他同事基本就走開了
然後就專注於那個問題直到把它解決掉


Peter would enforce this pretty strictly. He would say, I will not talk to you about anything else besides than this one thing I assigned you. I don't want to hear about how great you are doing over here, just shut up, and Peter would run away. And then focus until you conquer this one problem. And the insight behind this is that most people will solve problems that they understand how to solve. Roughly speaking, they will solve B+ problems instead of A+ problems. A+ problems are high impact problems for your company but they are difficult. You don't wake up in the morning with a solution, so you tend to procrastinate them. So imagine you wake up in the morning and create a list of things to do today, there's usually the A+ one on the top of the list, but you never get around to it. And so you solve the second and third. Then you have a company of over a hundred people so it cascades. You have a company that is always solving B+ things which does mean you grow, which does mean you add value, but you never really create that breakthrough idea. No one is spending 100% of their time banging their head against the wall every day until they solve it. So I highly recommend some version of that. You can be less stringent, you can give people three things to work on, but I would still track the concept of what would happen if you only gave everybody one thing to prioritize.

Peter堅持的這個信條背後透出的智慧是
很多人會選擇解決他們知道怎麼解決的問題
通俗來說他們會解決
B+的問題就不會去碰A+的問題
A+問題是對你公司影響很大的問題
但也更難解決
你不可能某天早上一睡醒就想到解決方法了
所以你會拖延
所以想像一下你早上起床
列出一個今天待辦事項的清單
清單的頂部通常是那些A+的事情
但是你一般會去選擇忽略它
你會跳過直接解決第二個第三個問題
慢慢的幾百人的公司都這麼做
你有了一個專註解決B+事情的公司
這樣你的確也會成長也會不斷的增值
但是你不會真的創造出突破性的點子建議
沒有人會花費百分之百的時間
每天用頭撞牆直到他們解決了所有問題
所以我強烈推薦這個方法
你可以不專注於最急迫的
這樣就會得到你想得到的
你可以給人們三件事去做但是還是要一直跟踪
如果你只給每個人一件優先級較高的事情
那會發生什麼
因為你不能決策所有的事情

You don't want to be making all these decisions yourself. You have to create tools that enable people to make decisions at the same level you would make them yourself. So how do you create scale and leverage? The first thing I would recommend is to build a dashboard. This is an old Square dashboard, it looks pretty presentable even today. The construct of the dashboard should be drafted by the founder. You need to simplify the value proposition in the company's metrics for success on a whiteboard. You can have other people build the dashboard, I don't care about that. But you need to draw it out. Like what does business success look to us and key inputs to those and then have someone create something that is very intuitive for every single person in the company, including customer support to use. And then, the key metric of whether you succeed is what fraction of your employees use that dashboard every day? If it's actually useful, it should be close to 100%. It's not going to be probably 100% but you want to measure that. Just like you have quality scores for your other KPI’s with users, your dashboard needs to be as intuitive as your product is for users.

你不想自己做所有的決定
所以你不得不創造出一個幫助人們做決定的工具
做出的決定與你的水平在同一水平面上
所以你怎樣擴大規模和影響力的？
我推薦的第一件事情是用一個儀錶盤
這是Square一個老式的儀錶盤
即使是今天看起來也非常直觀易懂
首先是儀錶盤的結構
應該是由創始人勾畫出一個草稿
最基本的你必須在公司的白板
簡化公司的價值定位
你可以讓其他人來搭建這個儀錶盤
我不介意
但是你必須把它最後塑造出來
比如商業成功對我們來說究竟如何定義？
成功的要素有哪些？
然後讓別的人做創造出一些
對每個人來說都很直觀的東西
甚至客戶都能很明白的使用
然後
你成功與否的關鍵因素
是每天有多少員工使用這個儀錶盤
如果它確實很有用這應該接近於百分之百
但是一般不可能是百分之百
但你需要計算這個數值
就像是你和用戶之間
所有其他KPI的量化指標一樣
就像你給用戶提供的商品一樣
儀錶盤也要非常直觀
另一件事情稍等

Another concept is transparency. Transparency people talk a lot about, it's a goal everybody ascribes to but when push comes to shove, very few people actually adhere to it. So let me walk through a little bit of transparency and different stages of transparency. Metrics are the first step. So everyone in your company should have access to what's going on. Other things I like to do, is to take your board decks. As you get more formal, the board decks will get more complicated. And actually review every single slide with every single employee after the board meeting. You can strip out the compensation information if you really want to. But every other slide you should go through with every single employee and explain it. If you can remember some of the feedback you got from your board that is really cool to pass on.

另一個概念是透明度
人們經常談論那個透明度的問題
這有點奇怪\N596\N00:22:26,​​900 --> 00:22:27,690\N好了
人們經常談論那個透明度問題
這是一個人人都在追尋的目標
但當有了助力的時候
很少人真正地堅持下去
所以我們粗略地談一下透明度
透明度的不同階段
度量是第一步
你公司裡的每一個人都應該了解
公司正在進行的每一件事
我喜歡做的另一件事是參加董事會
你的公司越正規你的董事會組成就會越複雜
開完董事會後
務必和每一位員工回顧一遍每一個幻燈片
如果你真的想的話可以把薪酬信息去掉
如果你真的想的話可以把薪酬信息去掉
但是除此之外的幻燈片
你都要和所有員工分享並解釋清楚
如果你可以記得你從會議董事會上得到的反饋
那就真的很棒了把它傳達給你的員工

Another thing we did at Square is when we scaled, not everybody is going to get invited to every meeting, but they are going to want to go to every meeting. The way you scale that is you create notes for every meeting and you send them to the entire company. So we created notes at least for every single meeting that involved more than two people, somebody would write notes and send it to the entire company. So everyone felt that as the company added employees, they continued to track what was interesting, what was going on. And they never felt excluded, hopefully. Another thing is, even details around conference rooms. Every conference room at Square has glass walls. Because as soon as you have regular walls, people wonder what's going on. It's amazing, if they can see who exactly is in the meeting and who is meeting with who when, they don't start to worry nearly as much as about what's going on behind those closed doors.

我們在Square做的另一件事情是
是經營公司的技巧
不是每一個人都能接到所有會議的邀請
但是他們會希望去參加每一次會議
解決的方法是你要做好每一次會議的會議紀要
等結束後發給整個公司
所以我為所有兩人以上的會議
分別建立了會議記錄
有專人會負責記錄然後發送給整個公司
所以即使公司在不斷的增加新人
他們依然能知道
公司正在發生什麼有意思的事情
他們從來不會感覺到被排斥
另一件事是
會議室裡的細節
Square的會議室都是玻璃牆
因為你一旦裝上普通的牆
人們會好奇里面正在發生什麼
令人驚奇的是如果他們能夠看到都有誰在參會
都是誰在什麼時候參加
他們不會擔心緊閉的門後發生了什麼
他們不會擔心緊閉的門後發生了什麼


Stripe, you may have seen a blog post about, I think Patrick wrote it, about email transparency, about actually allowing everyone to have access to email. That's pretty far out there but it has certain merits to it. I would call all the tactics you hear and read about as minimal viable transparency. I actually think you could push the envelope a lot more. Steve Jobs actually tried this at Next, he actually tried transparent compensation. I actually think that even though Next didn't do extremely well, the real reason wasn't around experimenting with compensation in transparency. There is a lot of merit to that. The critique of compensation transparency is, well we want people to be teammates and work together and collaborate. And if you look in the sports world where people are teammates and collaborate, all of their compensation is actually public. In fact, any one of us can look up one of their compensations in the sports world to get it exactly accurate. And somehow it seems to work. So I am not completely bought into that you need to keep compensation non-transparent.

你可能看過一個博客帖子
好像是Patrick寫的關於電子郵件的透明性
關於真的讓每個人都有權力去接觸所有的郵件
這看起來很遙遠
但實際上很有趣會起到一定作用
這裡我告訴你們的所有的策略
是最小可行透明度
我真的覺得你們可以多挑戰一些極限
喬布斯曾經在Next中嘗試過這個
他事實上嘗試過透明報酬機制
雖然我真的覺得Next在這件事上並沒有做的特好
但是真正的原因並不是圍繞著
透明報酬機制的實驗
以及它所帶來的一些問題
對於報酬透明化的批評通常會說
我希望大家能夠成為真正的團隊能夠一起通力合作
如果你放眼體育界
在體育界的運動員也都是真正的隊友
而且他們不得不在一起合作
他們的所有報酬工資都是公開的
相當於我們當中的任何人都可以看到他們的報酬
而且都相當的準確
這樣看起來是完全可行的
所以我不認為
你們需要保持報酬不透明

And finally, metrics. So you want to measure things. You want to measure outputs, not inputs. And again, you should dictate this yourself. You should draft the dashboard yourself to tie this all together. One important concept is pairing indicators. Which is, if you measure one thing and only one thing, the company tends not to optimize to that. And often at the expense of something that is important. Cost is example of payments and financial services is risk. It's really easy to give the risk team the objective and say, we want to lower our fraud rate. It sounds great. Until they start treating every user in this audience as a suspect because they want to lower the fraud rate. So they require each of you to call them up on the phone and give them more supplemental information and fax in things. Then you have the lowest fraud rate in the world, you also have the lowest level of customer satisfaction score.

最後一個衡量要素
你希望衡量某些東西
你想要衡量產出而不是投入
再一次你應該自己起草
你應該自己設計儀錶盤將這些連接起來
一個重要的概念是
配對指標
也就是說如果你只衡量一個東西就只是一個東西
公司傾向於優化它
並經常是以一些很重要的事情東西為代價的
支付領域的一個經典例子
金融服務通常是一種風險
給風險團隊一個目標很容易然後告訴風險團隊
“我們想要降低欺詐率”
聽起來很棒
直到他們開始對待每一個用戶
有持有懷疑的看法
因為他們想要降低欺詐率
所以他們要求用戶中的每一個人打電話
給他們更多的輔助信息傳真更多資料
然後你確實有了世界上最低的欺詐率
但是你也有了最低的消費者滿意率
但是你也有了最低的消費者滿意率

What you want to measure at the same rate as your fraud rate, is your false positive rate. That forces the team to actually innovate. Similarly, you can give recruiters metrics around hiring. And guess what? You will have a lot of people come in for interviews. But if you are not tracking the quality of interviewers, you may be very unhappy about the quality of people you are hiring and giving interviews to. So you always want to create the opposite and measure both. And the people responsible for that team need to be measured on both.

所以在降低欺詐率的同時
你還需要衡量誤判率
這會讓整個團隊進行真正地創新
相似的你可以給予招聘負責人一些指標猜猜會發生什麼？
你會有很多人們進來面試
但是如果你不追踪面試者的質量
你可能會對你面試的人或者
發了offer的人的質量非常失望
所以你一直需要從正反兩方面
來製定衡量指標

Finally around metrics. One insight I have had over my career is what you, you kind of want to look for the anomalies. You don't actually want to look for the expected behavior. So a famous example was at PayPal. None of the top ten markets that the company was planning on going after included eBay. One day, someone noticed that 54 of the sellers actually handwritten into their eBay listings, please pay me with Paypal and brought this to the attention of the executive team at the time. The first reaction from the executive team was, what the hell is going on? Let's get them out of the system, that is not the focus. Fortunately, David Sacks came back the next day and said, I think we found our market. Let's actually build tools for these power sellers instead of forcing them to write into their listing, pay me with PayPal. Why don't we just have an HTML button that they can just insert? And that actually worked. Then he thought, why should we have them insert it each time? Why don't we just automatically insert it for them? They can just insert it once, then every listing they have forever will have it automagically appear there. So that became the success for PayPal. Similarly I was at LinkedIn and I saw this stat that made no sense to me. The UI of the site was a little different then. 25% of all clicks, maybe 35% of all clicks from the homepage were people going to their own profile. And that didn't make any sense whatsoever. It was in the settings, you had to go to the margin and find a link. It was 25-35% of every click at scale, so this is just invalid stuff. And it made no sense whatsoever. I had never seen UI perform that way.

對於團隊成員的衡量需要考慮到兩方面
最後關於標準的問題根據我的職業經驗
一個要點是你要關注異常現象
那些預期中的行為並不是你想要的
所以一個有名的例子是在PayPal
十所頂尖的市場沒有一所是
公司計劃去追逐的包括eBay
但是一天有人注意到54個超級賣家
在eBay清單上寫下了
“請用PayPal支付”
這引起了執行團隊的注意
執行隊伍的第一個反應是
到底發生了什麼？
讓我們把他們趕出系統吧
這並不是我們所關注的
幸運的是David Sacks第二天回來了
說我認為我們找到我們的市場
讓我們為這些賣家創造出工具
這樣他們就不用在他們的清單中寫到
“請用PayPal支付”
為什麼我們不設置一個HTML的按鈕讓他們可以直接按下去？
那真的是有效的
然後他想
我們為什麼要讓他們每次都要自己按下去呢？
我們為什麼要讓他們每次都要自己按下去呢？
我們為什麼不自動為他們設置用PayPal支付呢？
所以他們只需要輸入一次
每一個清單就會永久保留
就會自動地出現了
這就變成了PayPal的成功
類似的我在LinkedIn的時候也有相似的情況
我當時也看到了這些沒什麼意義的數據
網站的界面設置後來有了一些不同
25%到30%的主頁點擊率
是為了到達他們自己的主頁
這一點都不科學
就像你得先找到設置
然後到網站邊緣找鏈接
這樣的點擊竟然佔據了25%到30%
這看起來只是一個統計數據
真的毫無意義
我從來沒有見過那樣的頁面設置

I went around for weeks trying to figure this out, then someone smart, actually it was Max Levchin, said something to me and I was like, he was like, it's vanity. I was like, ah ha! People are looking at themselves in the mirror. Thats a very good answer, because they weren't editing their profile. Nobody has something to edit everyday in their profile. But they were just looking at themselves in the mirror every day because it made them feel good. Then you could test that with, if I had more content would I look at myself in the mirror more often? It turns out, you did. If you had more endorsements would you look at yourself more in the mirror? You did. So we figured out what was underneath the utilitarian product, the product the team thought they were building was actually more emotional vanity. It didn't actually translate to the best feature like the Paypal example. We couldn't exactly put a button up that said, be more vain today on the homepage. That probably would not work perfectly. So it really never really took off like the Paypal example did. But it really clarified what users of the product really wanted. And we wouldn't have found that if we hadn't looked through anomalous data.

我花了幾個星期試著去
弄清楚這個問題於是聰明的某人幫了我的忙
事實上是Max Levchin對我說
他說這是某種虛榮心
我當時就是靈光一現原來用戶們都在照鏡子啊
那是一個很好的答案
因為他們沒有編輯自己的檔案
沒有人每天都要往裡面增添新的東西
但是他們就是照照鏡子看看自己
因為這會使他們感覺很好
然後你可以證明
如果我有更多的內容
那我會更加頻繁的照鏡子看自己麼？
事實證明你會的
如果你得到更多支持
你會照鏡子更加頻繁嗎？
事實證明你會的
所以我們了解到
產品團隊認為他們在創造一款實用的產品
但是隱藏更深層次的是\N758\N00:28:09,130​​ --> 00:28:11,210\N最大的滿足虛榮心
他可能並沒有轉變成最好的功能
例如PayPal
我們不能簡單地放個按鈕在主頁
就像當下比較流行的做法
那可能根本就不會起作用
所以就不會不像Paypal那樣發展
但是它真的清楚了用戶真正想要的是什麼
但是它真的清楚了用戶真正想要的是什麼
如果我們沒有瀏覽我們的異常數據我們就沒法發現它

The final topic I want to talk about is details. And in my assigned reading there is a great book by Bill Walsh, called The Score Takes Care of Itself. And the basic point of the book is that if you get all the details right, you don't worry about how to build a billion dollar business, you don't worry about how to have a billion dollars in revenue, you don't worry about having a billion users. Thats a byproduct of what you do everyday to get the details excellent. So the topics that he talks about in the book that really resonated with me was, he took over the 49ers in 1979. They were the worse team in football, I believe they were 2 in 14 which is really bad if you don't know football. In the next ten years he transformed the team into NFL’s best, won three super bowls. And what's the first thing he did to go from the worse team to one of the best in many ways? He actually taught the receptionist to answer the phone properly. He wrote a three page memo on how to answer the phone.

我想說的最後一個話題是細節
在我的指定閱讀材料中
有一本Bill Walsh的好書
名字叫The Score Takes Care of Itself
這本書的主旨是
如果你把所有細節弄準確了
你就不必擔心如何建造一個大企業
你不必擔心如何有十億美元的進賬
你不必擔心如何獲得十億的用戶
那些只是你每天做的日常事務每個細節做到完美
隨之而來的副產品
所以他在書中談論的與我產生最大共鳴的話題是
他1979年接管了49人的隊
這是當時很爛的球隊
我記得他們前一年的戰績是2和14
如果你不了解橄欖球我可以告訴你這真的糟透了
在接下來的十年中他將這個團隊變成了
NFL最佳球隊贏了三次超級碗
他做了什麼來完成這個轉變的呢？
把糟糕的球隊變成最好的球隊第一件事是什麼？
他事實上先告訴了前台如何正確地接聽電話
他寫了一個三頁的備忘錄關於如何接電話

And that may sound absurd but what his point was organization as a whole does everything exactly the right way. Then receivers will start running their routes at 7 yards not 8 yards. And that actually will matter. And if every person on the team executes to the same level of performance, you will have a team that is performing at the highest possible level. And at the highest performance level, the team will play at their best. So how to relate this to a company may include a lot of details that do not matter, not seem that they matter superficially. Most people would agree that details matter when faced with the user. But what the real debate it is on things that don't face the use. Steve Jobs famously in the Mac, insisted upon an immaculate circuit board, you can read about this in various books. The Mac, for those of you who don't remember the Mac. Maybe most of you here, but may have seen it. It couldn't be opened. So the circuit board couldn't be seen by any person in the world. There was no way to open the Mac except by the people that worked at Apple.

那可能會聽起來很荒謬
但是他的重點是在站在全局組織上
將所有事情都用正確的方式去完成
比如接球手會在7碼半開跑
而不是7碼不是8碼
這半碼真的是很重要
如果團隊裡的每一個人在執行上
都能表現出相同的高水準
那麼你會有一個績效達到
最高的團隊
隨著充足的變化
團隊會表現的最好
所以如果要把這個結論用在公司上
可能包括很多不重要的細節
至少是表面上不重要的細節
許多人都會同意說面對用戶的時候細節的確很重要
但真正的爭論點是在那些
不直接面對用戶的事情上
喬布斯因為MAC而聲名顯赫
堅持完美無瑕的電路設計
你可以在很多的書中讀到它
你們之中可能很多的人都不記得MAC
當然可能這裡所有人都不記得了
但應該有人是見過的MAC是沒法被打開的
所以電路設計不能
被其他人看到
除了蘋果內部人員沒有人能打開Mac


Steve insisted that it be absolutely perfect and beautiful. That is the sort of detail obsession that building this sort of company requires. Examples that may be a bit more practical for you instead of circuit boards may be, what sort of foods do you serve people? It actually matters more than you might guess. When people don't like the food you serve them, what do they do? They go gossip, they go complain to their friends, they walk over to someones desk. Then all of a sudden that lunch that they are complaining about is what they are spending most of their time gossiping and complaining instead of brainstorming. You don't have this serendipities idea matching another serendipities idea that creates a spark instead they are all wallowing and whittling around. The best thing you can do is give people the food they want or the food thats good for them that makes them more productive. So it may seem like this glorious job you thought you had is more like running around being a TaskRabbit for people. But it is to take things off their plate that is a distraction so they can be high performance machines. And if you take enough things away from people to distract them and give them the tools to be successful, all of a sudden your organization produces a lot more.

喬布斯堅持認為它應該完美無缺
這就是細節狂熱者
是建造偉大公司所需要的
相比較電路闆對你們更加實用的例子可能是
比如你們招待人們什麼食物？
它可能比你能想像的更加重要
當人們不喜歡你招待他們的食物
他們會怎麼做？
他們會把這件事八卦給各種人
會去找朋友抱怨
去直接跑到別人桌前去說
然後你會發現眨眼間在午餐時間
他們都在抱怨那頓飯
他們的時間基本上都浪費在八卦或者抱怨上
而不是集思廣益上了
所以你可能真的沒有意識到這一小點
更不用說其他能帶來巨大創意的點子了
而事實上他們真的就在企業運營的每一個過程中
所以你能做的最好的事情
就是給人們他們想要的食物或者是對他們健康的食物
讓他們更加有活力
你會發現很多時候你認為光榮的工作
更加像是一種跑腿外包的服務
更加像是一種跑腿外包的服務
但是起到了掃除乾擾人們注意力的作用
而其他人則能因此更加高效
如果你把乾擾人們發揮的東西拿走
並能夠提供給他們獲得成功的工具
你會發現你的企業的產出會變得更高效

Similarly, often one that people get wrong is office space. So one natural thing is when you need an office to have an office manager of your team go out and find offices. And they will go out and come back with photos and ideas. You need to do that yourself. The office environment that people work in everyday dictates the culture that you are going to be in. And the final thing, then I am going to take some questions, is around effort.


相似的另一個容易出錯的地方就是辦公場地
當你要找一個辦公室的時候自然而然的
你會讓一個辦公室負責人出去
或者讓你團隊中的一員出去找辦公室
他們會跟著中介到處跑
然後帶著很多照片和點子回來
但是你應該自己做這些事情
人們工作的辦公室環境
會反映你的企業文化
以及他們如何做決策甚至可以反映員工的努力程度
在確定你的公司將如何成長的過程中
幾乎沒有什麼決定比選擇
你們所在的辦公環境更重要了
但是很多人並不這麼做
最後一個話題是努力
然後我會回答一些問題
從根本上來說我不相信


Ultimately I don't believe you can create a company without a lot of effort and that you need to lead by example. So Bill Walsh, in the first chapter of his book, he asks this question, how do you know you are doing the job? And this is the quote that he gave everyone when asked that question. So if this is how you feel everyday then you're probably on the right track. If it doesn't sound appetizing then you shouldn't start a business truthfully. And with that I am done with the prepared part and I will see if anyone has any questions that I can try to be helpful with.

下面是一些例子
所以Bill Walsh
在他的書的第一章中問了一個這樣的問題
你如何知道自己在做自己應該做的事？
這是他給教練的一個回答
這是他給教練的一個回答
如果這是你每天的感覺你可能就處於正軌
如果你不覺得這個方面很吸引你
你可能並不適合創辦一家企業
上面的就是我準備的演講的部分


接下來看下誰​​有問題
我會盡力幫助解答
有什麼問題嗎？
請說

Q: So you talked about making compensation transparent. How would you do that, especially when people equate themselves to the value of how much their salary is?

你談論的有關薪酬透明化的問題
你是怎麼辦到的特別是當人們將自己掙了多少錢
等同於自己到底值多少錢

A: I would do it probably in bands. You can do it, just everybody in the company gets paid the same. Or you could have all discipline, all engineers-- Or you could do it by experience. How Steve did it at Next was there was a high band and a low band. You either had a lot of experience or a low experience and that was it. So low band, now would be about $85,000 flat. Everyone flatly gets paid $85,000, if you are a supervisor with experience everybody gets paid $130,000 and that's just it. Sort of the Next translated for inflation.

你談論的有關薪酬透明化的問題
你是怎麼辦到的特別是當人們將自己掙了多少錢
等同於自己到底值多少錢
我想在一個小團隊中
你可以做到
你可以給公司裡所有的人統一標準的定工資
但是你也可以把例如行政人員工程師
或者不同經驗的人分成同樣薪酬標準的小團隊
喬布斯在Next的做法是
劃分一個水平高的類別和一個低水平的類別
你要么有很多經驗或是很少經驗
經驗較少者
差不多平均薪酬在85000美元左右
平均每個人都會得到85000美元
但如果你是有經驗的管理人員平均會得到130000美元
這是Next對薪酬的一個理解
相對於有多少細節…


Q: So the question is, besides food, what sort of details do others care about?

你會認為是讓人驚喜的？
所以問題是除了食物之外

A: The laptops they use. This is just a default everybody has. Five years ago it was a benefit to get people high powered machines as opposed to optimizing our cost by having Dell Machines and ugly monitors, just as an example. If you think about all these people who are relentlessly resourceful and equally talented in a mass competitive ecosystem competing for talent, you learn to give people the best possible tools to do the best possible job. So rigorously asking, how do I make people more successful, what things do they not need to be working on, or distracting. And what things can I give them to make them more valuable per day? Then just break that down per day and solve that stuff yourself.

有比如他們使用的筆記本電腦
我知道現在來說這相當於是必備品了
但是在五年前
給員工一台高性能的電腦是一種福利
因為很多公司會為了優化成本
會給員工配戴爾台式機並配上很醜的顯示器這只是舉個例子
所以如果你希望打造一個環境讓這些足智多謀
有天賦的人們為了展現才能
而極力競爭的話
你要學會給予這些人最好的工具
去最可能高效完美的完成工作
所以大略來說
我是怎樣使人們更加成功的？
有什麼讓他們分心的事情我可以幫他們掃除？
還有我可以做什麼事情
去讓他們更加有價值？
我每天都在思考這些問題

Q: When you are in a startup environment, resources are scarce. How do you optimize for those things?

那當你在一個創業的環境中
你如何來優化這些細節？
因為資源是有限的

A: That's a good question. First of all I think you must have your own office. I don't believe ever in shared office spaces. Peter talks a little about this, that every good startup is a cult. And it's really hard to create a cult if you are sharing space with people. Because a cult means you think you are better than every other startup, you have a special way of doing things that's better than anyone else in the world. And if you are sharing physical space with others it's very hard to internalize that. So I would start there. But it is a prioritization question. Everywhere is scarce, so it's just a question of the magnitude of zeros you are paying attention to. Probably not $10 expenditure, but $100, $1000, $10,000, then $1 million starts being a rounding error.

So I would figure out is what is the most important, a quality office that creates a good vibe that allows you to recruit people. Because recruits are very savvy about this. They walk into your office and they can tell a lot about the culture instantly. I can walk into a company office and I can tell whether or not I am going to invest as soon as I walk in. Seriously, I just absolutely rule things out that I don't want to invest in as soon as I walk in. And there's times I walk in an office, like wow this is really impressive. You can tell how people work together, how hard they are working, how distracted they are. Roelof Botha at Sequoia made a point to me about YouTube. So when I invested in YouTube in the very very beginning, it wasn't obviously going to be successful. Then Roelof led this series A Investment for this client on YouTube and we were at a board meeting together and he said, I really think Youtube is going to work. I said, Why? And he said, every time I go to one of my portfolios companies half the office is watching Youtube during their lunch. I was like, really good sign. And so you pick up on these little things and you can predict a lot.

是個好問題
首先你必須有你自己的辦公室
首先你必須有你自己的辦公室
我不喜歡共享的辦公室空間
Peter曾經對此有過評論
每一個好的初創公司都像是一個宗教團隊
如果你和別人共享辦公空間的話
你真的很難創造一個宗教團體
因為一個專屬的派別意味著你認為
你比世界上其他的人都更優秀
你獨特的做事方式\N930\N00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37​​,680\N和任何人都不一樣\N931\N00:34:37​​,680 --> 00:34:39,380\N如果你與別人共享空間
就很難給團隊灌輸這樣的想法了
所以我要有一個自己的辦公室空間
當然你可能會有其他的優先級判斷
如果你的資源有限
每一個人的資源都很有限只不過是數量級的問題
就看你願意為此投入多少
可能不是10美元的支出
是100美元1000美元
10000美元100萬美元10000萬美金
這個問題會循環出現
所以我會找出確定
什麼才是最重要的
一個高質量的辦公室會創造出一個非常好的氛圍
來幫助你招聘更多優秀的人才
因為職員對這些非常在意
他們走進你的辦公室
他們可以從辦公室裡覺察出你的公司文化
我常常一走進一個公司的辦公司我就能知道
我是否想要投資
說真的我會因為第一時間的一些不好的感覺
不想投資這家公司
或者我有時走進一個辦公室
我會發出哇的驚嘆
你可以從辦公室裡看出人們是怎樣在一起工作
他們工作的有多努力或者是他們有多麼不專心
Sequoia的Roelof Botha曾經向我提到過YouTube
所以我在非常非常早的階段
就投資了YouTube
它當時並沒有很顯著的表現出成功的跡象
在這之後Roelof領頭了YouTube的A輪融資
有一次我們在一起開董事會
他說他覺得Youtube是真的會成功
我問為什麼
她說
每次我去投資其他的公司
差不多辦公室一半人在午飯時間都在看Youtube
我認為這是一個非常好的兆頭
所以你從辦公室中可以看到很多細節真的可以預測很多東西

A: What do you think is the best way of getting street credit as a new manager?

你認為什麼作為新管理層得到街頭威望的最​​好的方式是什麼？

Q: Oh boy. Almost all good managers in Silicon Valley are promoted because of their individual performance. In cultures that are bureaucratic the percentage is even higher. So we tried in PayPal to only promote people who were kicking ass at their discipline. Peter didn't believe in general managers. In fact I remember going for a job around campus with him my first week of PayPal. He was asking me how things were going, other kinds of CEO questions. Then we got in this debate about whether the company needed any more managers. He was like, nope. No managers. We are only going to promote people, so the VP in engineering is going to be the single best engineer. The VP of design is going to be the single best designer. The VP of product, is going to be the single best product person. And they are going to learn to manage later. The advantage of that is you don't demoralize people. Because everyone knows their boss is actually better at their job than they are. And they can learn stuff. And you can learn a little bit of the management techniques later, as opposed to promoting people who are just good people managers that don't have the discipline and skill.

That demoralizes people, so I think just being excellent at something and then being excellent at getting a bunch of people to do something is the next task. But people, some things you just have to learn by doing. Some people can’t learn to play the guitar by reading a book. You have to actually try to manage a bit and you won't do well at first. I have another set of tactics and classes on what you actually do when you transition from an individual to a manager. It's hard. One of the first things people don't get right right away is their timing allocation. Actually, what I would recommend is doing what I call a calendar audit. And track what you spend your time on in a month. How much is editing, how much is writing, etc. And optimize it over time. You can get a mentor. Find someone who’s been a manager before that will work with you. Not your boss, because your boss has a set of complicated objectives including how much are we shipping. A mentor can just focus on you and making you more successful.

好這個問題是新管理層獲得街頭威望的
最好的做法是什麼？
幾乎所有的矽谷的好的管理人員
都是因為他們出色的個人表現得到晉升
這個比例甚至比我說的更高
在Paypal的時候我嘗試著只去提拔那些
表現非常驚豔的成員
Peter完全不相信經理之類的角色
事實上我非常清楚的記得
在PayPal的第一周我和他在園區裡散步
他問我近況如何
就是那些CEO都會問的那些問題
然後我們就陷入了一場爭論
關於公司是否需要更多的管理人員
他認為不
不要更多的管理層
我們只需要提拔出色的人
工程行業副總裁
會成為最棒的工程師
設計行業的副總裁會成為最棒的設計師
產品副總裁會成為最棒的產品設計者
他們會在後來的時間裡慢慢學習如何管理
這樣做的好處是你不會使人們士氣低落
因為每個人都知道
他們的上司比他們更擅長做他們的工作因為他們絕對可以學到新東西
你可以在之後的時間裡學習管理技能
而不是只去提拔那些
只是比較會管人的成員他們的專業能力可能並不是很強
那樣的話會使員工沮喪士氣低落
所以我認為能出色的做好一些事情
讓一群人變得更出色則是
下一個任務
但是有一些事情
你只有親手去實踐了才能有所學
就像是一些人無法只看書本學會彈吉他
你必須試著管理
所以你一開始沒有必要做到非常好
我在針對
你如何由個體貢獻者轉變為
管理人員有一系列的課程與技巧
它很難
其中一項是人們不能很合理的分配他們的時間
我會推薦你做一個
“日程審計”和“工作追踪” 做一個月
來看下你是怎麼樣使用利用你的時間的
管理用了多少時間寫東西用了多少時間等等
然後逐步優化自己的時間分配
你可以有一名指導者一個原來和你一起共事
後來成為一名管理者的人但那個人絕對不是你的老闆
因為你的老闆可能會有一系列的複雜目標去處理
比如我們會發布多少新東西之類的
一位導師可以對你集中註意力
讓你變得更加成功

Q: What are some things you can do to ensure a consistent voice in the company?

能不能告訴我們一些例子
你如何在公司的發展過程中一直以統一的態度表達公司的立場
尤其是對於成長型的公司

A: So I would look at every piece of copy in every department. Another part that is hardly ever, look at your recruiting website. It almost never has the same quality as your conversion funnel. I would look at customer support. Another classic area that is never up to the same quality. Treat customer support as a product so you actually have an engineering team and a design team that over time focuses on making that world class. Usually we have other executives at a scaled company. Most executives were trained differently at other companies and bring that with them. You have to crosstrain that. So if you hired a VP of engineering of Google its very different than a Design Leader from Apple. They don't actually learn anything the same way. So you are going to have to stitch that together some how. Either one or the other is going to have to learn the other style. Or you are going to have to create your own style and really teach that to your executives. So it shows up all the time. All you have to do is pick up the company's products and look for things that have a different voice and you can see it, visual voice, word choice, all over the map.

我會去查看每一個部門的每一份文件
有一些部分從來沒能做的很好
你可以看看你的招聘網站
他們的內容從來都很難跟上公司的發展
和質量的要求
我會去看看用戶支持情況
這裡的內容常常不能達到同樣的標準
我會像對待產品一樣要求用戶支持質量
所以你可以真正有一個
逐漸可以成為世界一流水平的
工程團隊和一個設計團隊
通常在一個具有一定規模的公司你會有不同的決策者
他們來自於不同的公司經歷過不一樣的培訓
會把這些不同帶到你的公司來
你需要把他們再培養成適應你的要求的人
比如你從谷歌找來一個工程師擔任副總
他會和你從蘋果找來的設計總監
非常不同
他們的做事風格完全不同
所以你要想辦法讓他們配合在一起
或者其中一位去適應另外一位
或者是你自己創造出你自己獨特的風格
然後把這個風格傳達給你這兩位高管
這種情況一直發生
所以你要做的就是選擇這個公司的產品
並尋找那些擁有不同意見的東西
然後你就明白了
可視化的聲音文字的選擇等等五花八門

Sam Altman: Can you talk a little about the tactics of how you manage people? How often do you meet with them?

A: So the canonical advice sounds obvious but was radical back in 1982 when Andy wrote his book, is to have a one on one roughly every two weeks. Some people say every week, but I wouldn't go longer than two weeks. Every week can be ideal in many companies. The reason why there is another adage, you should only have five to seven direct reports. That actually derives on the concept of having a one on one every week. The director reports is so you can fit enough one on ones in your calendar a week and get other things done. I think one on ones once a week is ideal. I think the agenda should be crafted by the employee that reports the manager, not the manager. The one on one is mostly to benefit the employee. They should walk in with, these are the three things I want to talk about. Even bullet points in advance by email so you have time to chew on it, and you're not on the fly winging your answers. But that's probably the best structure. But if someone is really good and been doing this a long time and has internal credibility you might push out the one every week to once every two weeks. Maybe every month. I don't know that I would go beyond once a month ever.

Q: When is it acceptable to compromise and hire someone that is ammunition instead of someone who is barrel?

你可以講一些管理人員的技巧的嗎？
你與他們見面的頻率是多少？

A: Truthfully you are going to hire more ammunition, naturally, than barrels. So there is a ratio between the two. The question is the ratio. At some point the ratio is going to get out of whack, you will have only one barrel in the company and fifty engineers. You might as well have ten engineers because you are not going to get any work done. You are just wasting resources. You are going to frustrate engineers because everyone is going to need your approval. Your signoff. Your editing. It's just going to stack and get frustrating to people. I think roughly one, to ten, to twenty is the right range. You don't need more engineers until you have more barrels. Designers are a little different. But you are always going to be hiring more ammunition than barrels. A good barrel will have a feel for that. One way to correct for this is, there is this natural tendency to create headcount on your team. Like an empire building tendency. Like I manage twenty people and Sam only manages ten and you manage three. So I'm more important than Sam. And Sam is more important than you. Put an X here, over Y which equals the output, and specify how many things they have done successfully and then divide by the number of people on their team. And tell them this is going to be the grade for their performance review. Shockingly the Y doesn't start increasing on that team. It's amazing how this works and be explicit about it.

正規的建議在現在顯而易見但是其實
在1982年的時候Andy寫了他的第一本書那時候比較激進的建議是
是大概每隔兩個星期就有一次一對一的溝通
有一些人建議是每星期一次
我不認為可以比兩個星期更長
實際上每週一次在許多企業中是很理想的
實際上還有一個經驗之談就是
你應該只有5-7個直接對你匯報的人
那實際上是來自於一個概念：每週一次一對一的溝通
這樣的話你可以將一對一談話加入到你的日程表
並且可以安排其他事情
我覺得一個星期進行一次一對一的溝通很理想
並且已經由向經理報告的員工們來安排
而不是經理本人
一對一的溝通主要是為了員工的利益
所以他們應該自己參與進來
這裡是我想要討論的幾點內容
理想的情況是他們會不斷循環
要溝通的點可以事先通過電子郵件作為重點先列出來
所以你有時間去反复考慮
不會對你的答案拿不准
那可能是最好的結構
如果某人真的很棒很有才華
並且做某項工作已經很久了
在公司內部已經樹立了足夠的可信度
你可以將一個星期一次的頻率
改為每兩個星期一次也可能是每個月一次
不過我不認為我會超過一個月
在什麼時候這種妥協是可以被接受的
當你僱傭了“火藥型”員工不是“槍筒型”員工
那這個問題是什麼時候什麼時候你會妥協
僱傭更多的“火藥”而不是“槍筒”
事實上你將要雇傭更多的有“火藥” 能力的人
而不是“槍筒”
所以兩者之間存在一定的比率
問題就在於這個比率
在某些時候這個比率會出問題
比如你是整個公司裡唯一的“火藥”
你有50個工程師但是也許你其實只需要10個
因為你的精力有限
這樣你只是在浪費資源
你會使你的工程師很洩氣
因為每個人都需要得到你的批准
你的簽字你的指正
這種情況堆積起來對人們來說只會更加低效沮喪
真的是這樣在不同的領域裡比如工程師
我認為大概是1比10到20
是一個比較合適的比例
你不需要更多的工程師
直到你有更多的“槍筒”
設計師有一些不同
但是你終將會僱傭更多的火藥型人才而非槍筒型
一個好的領導
對這個比例會有一定的把握
這是一個糾正這個問題的方法
還有一種自然的趨勢是團隊的負責人會不斷增加團隊人數
就像是一個帝國鑄造的趨勢
就像是我管理20個人
Sam只管理10個人你只管理3個人
所以我比Sam更加重要
Sam又比你更加重要
解決這個問題是設一個X值
是團隊人數不好意思是輸出
然後再進一步明確是他們成功地做了多少事情
是一個明確的數量然後除以團隊成員數量
告訴他們這個就是他們的績效等級
令人震驚的是Y並沒有開始增長
這個方法的效果非常令人吃驚
並且非常清晰

Q: How often, as a venture capitalist, do you meet and interact with your companies?

作為風投
多久你會干涉你投資的公司
A: When we invest, we do do some seed companies where we invest less money, but when we invest in a series A or B round, we join the board and roughly I meet with the founder or CEO every two weeks. That's the default. Obviously there are inflection moments when things go right or wrong and then it's on an ad hoc basis. Actually right now I do a lot by text message. I even have one CEO who Snapchats me all the time. Which I would actually rather he not, but the world has changed a lot. But I try in person meetings every two weeks.

作為一個風險投資人
我會多久和我投資的公司門見面
通常來說我們會進行一些
種子輪的投資我們會投資較少的資金
但是當我們的投資金額達到一定的量
我們領投了一輪比如A輪B輪
之後我們會加入董事會我大概每兩個星期

公司開始往好的或者壞的方向發展
有些溝通可能不那麼正式
事實上
最近我處理很多事情都是通過發短信
投資的一家公司的CEO甚至一直給我發Snapchat
其實我更希望他不要這樣但只能這樣
這個世界改變了很多
但是我還是會嘗試著每兩個星期開一次面對面的會議

Q: ?

A: No. Being a venture capitalist to me is like being more of a psychologist. So if you come to my office we have two chairs with a table in the middle. And we sit down and it's like, Tell me your problems. My response is usually, have you thought about this? Have you talked to this person? Have you tried this? Etc. It's just asking a lot of questions and going back like that. But that's 90% of what I do.

作為一名風險投資人
對我來說更多地像一名心理學家

以如果你來我的辦公室
你會看見我們有兩把椅子
類似於這樣排列中間有個小桌子
然後我們坐下來
就像這樣“告訴我你的問題所在”
你懂吧？然後
就像這樣問問題
比如說你這樣過嗎
我的回答通常是
“你好好考慮過這個問題嗎?”
“你和這個人談過嗎？”
你曾經與他談論過這個問題嗎?”等等
這就是詢問許多問題
然後循環往復
我90%的工作就是在做這些
假設當你得到了這些“槍筒型”人才
你的公司開始的時候做的很不錯
並且你在這個項目上
你聽說你一直在招聘

Q: ?

聽說你一直在招聘
是的
那你如何來做到一個平衡
A: Well it depends on where your prioritizations are. Sam talked a little about this in his lecture. So a company will move recruiting first, second, or third. Somewhere in that spectrum. If it's your number one priority then 25% is probably a good allocation. Actually I like the calendar audit more for CEOs even moreso than new managers. So when I work with CEOs that aren't thriving in that role for the first time, I actually force them to show my their calendar. Now I am going to ruin this trick. But I ask them to write them out on paper and specify whatever they are. Then I ask them to pull out their calendar and see if it matches. And it never matches. Never. Recruiting is the one that is usually the most often awry. Half the CEOs will say recruiting is their number one priority. It's almost never the biggest block of time on anyone's calendar. So that is what you are trying to do is match resources to priorities in the calendar audit. And there is no software that does this really well for you. It would be great, right now we pull up someone's Google calendar and hand count up the hours. Which is insane. But that is the best way, just ask about their priorities. Priorities are raising money, you don't want to allocate most of your time recruiting. One more question.

很好這取決於你的優先權在哪裡
Sam在他的講座裡
談到了這一點
每家公司都會把招聘擺在第一
第二或者第三的位置上
如果招聘是你的第一要務
那25%可能是一個好的分配
事實上我更喜歡“日程審查”
相對於新經理來說更喜歡審查CEO
所以當我與初次上任
沒有什麼經驗的CEO們合作的時候
我事實上強迫他們給我看他們的日程表
在做這個之前我要去掉這項
我會要求他們在紙上寫下來
寫清楚哪一項需要優先
然後去談論他們
然後對照他們的日程表看是否符合
但其實從來沒有符合的時候
從來沒有
招聘其實是一件經常出錯的事情
比如你遇到的CEO裡面有一半人會說
招聘是他們優先級最高的事情
這幾乎從來不是任何人的日程表上
最大的那一部分
所以這就是你要做的事情匹配資源和投入
針對不同的優先級審查日程表
但是目前沒有一款軟件能把這個功能做的很好
如果那樣就太好了
事實上
我們拿出某人的日程表
然後人工計算時間
但是這是絕對不可能的
但是這是發現你的優先級的
最好的方式
如果你優先的事情就是融資
你不會想分配100%的時間來招聘
這段時間你會希望分配相當一部分時間來準備融資的事情
直到融資成功

Q: On the surface some of this advice is contradictory. How do you harmonize those roles?

表面來看學生們會覺得一些建議有些自相矛盾
因為你強調重點需要優先通行
放下一些不是很重要的事情
但是你又說關注所有的細節
也是很必要的
你如何來協調這些
A: It's a good question. How do you harmonize when details really matter, but you've got that one thing to do, you want to only allocate time to those one, two, or three things. How do you put those things together? There is some tension even in a healthy organization. There is some tension of why are we focused on writing the script as opposed to something the user may see.

The underlying philosophy of getting the details right is pretty important to install in the very very beginning of a company. Because people will start acting that way and making decisions that way themselves. So you won't have to literally do that. If you have to actually do that then that shows the foundation isn't that solid. When you first start the company it's about getting the details right. Everyone is precise, everyone on every task is always thinking that way. And then that scales, the people you bring in will think that way, the people that think that way will tend to get hired and those who can’t wont get hired. Each team and each leader will tend to enforce that themselves. So the CEO is almost never doing it. So it's partially how do you start. And the key to culture is it's a framework for making decisions. And if it's baked into your culture, people learn how to make decisions across that culture without you ever saying anything. You never have to really do anything except watch and promote and move people around.

Cool. Well I guess that's it.

Thank you.


這是一個很好的問題
我想是有方法來協調一致的
事實上如何協調那些
真正重要的細節
你只有一件事情要做
因為你的精力有限所以你需要把它們合理分配到優先級靠前的幾件事情上
如何把兩件事聯繫在一起呢？
事實上矛盾總是會存在的以及是一家健康的企業也會存在
比如相對於我們把重點集中在
專注於寫腳本而不是專注於用戶可以看見的東西
這就存在著矛盾
關於如何處理細節問題
這個基本理念是非常重要的
尤其是對於初創公司
因為人們會按照這個方式開始工作
按照那種方式做決定
所以你不需要刻意去那些做
如果你真的做了
那些證明了企業基礎並不堅固
當你第​​一次創立企業的時候
你需要把細節處理好
每一個人都是精確運轉的
每一個任務中的每一個人都要按照這個理念在工作
企業慢慢地擴大規模
當你再招人進來就會變得自然而然
處理好細節的人更有可能被招進來
沒有這種能力的人就不會
每一個團隊每一個負責人
會以身作則
帶頭實踐那種思維模式
尤其
在這種文化下你如何起步
我的意思是文化的關鍵是規則
這就是決策的框架工作
如果你有一個人
在某種特定文化中學習如何作出決定
你從來不需要真正做什麼事情除了觀察和提拔
還有分配人們做不同的事情
很酷我覺得就應該那樣謝謝
